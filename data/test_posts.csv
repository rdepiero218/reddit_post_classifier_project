8,I am going to attempt to count all of the lights in Diamond City(No Mods),1601492843,"So one day(today) I was bored out of mind in Diamond City shopping for scrap when after I took a good look around Diamond City and I realized that there are ALOT of lights in Diamond City so after counting how many this is the result:

P.S I am not counting neon lights so sorry Nick.

P.P.S here are the types of lights I found in Diamond City:

Bulb lights,

Lantern lights,

Searchlights,

Fluorescent lights,

and fire lanterns.

The Stadium lights:When I refer to stadium lights I mean the big spotlights on the stadium walls that point down into the city,anyway there are 7 spotlights,2 do not work,so that makes 5 spotlights to count.The first one has 48 working bulbs,the second on has 34 working bulbs,the third one has 37 working bulbs,the fourth one has all 75 bulbs in working order,and the fifth one also as 34 working bulbs.Since 48+34+37+75+34 equals 228,we can conclude that there are 228 bulbs in working order on the stadium.

The Upper-Stands:This one is pretty easy since the upper-stands are small and as so doesn't need so many lights so after counting I can conclude that there are 36 lantern lights,3 fluorescent lights,and only one searchlight.Adding these up we get exactly 40 lights.

Now before I count the lights in Diamond City proper I need to say that in order for me to make counting easier i'm going to divide the DC proper into sections so please bear with me.Now let's continue!

Home,Third,First,and Second street:These are the main streets of DC where everyone lives,the combined total of the number of lights here is 38.There were 19 lantern lights,14 bulb lights,and 5 fluorescent lights.

Sheng Kawolski's Water shop/DCR(Diamond City Radio):There are 25 total lights in this area,which were 2 searchlights,20 bulb lights under the DCR studio(I know weird place),2 standslights,and 1 fire lantern.

The Farm/the stage:If your confused about what area I'm talking about,I'm talking about the area that place where McDonough made his speech and the small farm right across to it,anyway after counting there are 6 standlights,10 lantern lights and 2 fluorescent lights,adding to a total of 18 lights.

The Market:I just want to say this took me quite a while because there are so many lights here but I will do my best,anyway after counting the total is 243 lights with 27 of them being lantern lights,8 of them being searchlights,another 8 being fluorescent lights,and 200 of them being bulb lights.

So with the numbers we have we can add 228+200+40+38+25+18=549.There you have it folks,an astounding 549 lights!

Kill Me.

TL;DR:There are 549 lights in Diamond City and I now wanna die.",Fallout,Mrminutemansupreme,False,/r/Fallout/comments/j2sih0/i_am_going_to_attempt_to_count_all_of_the_lights/

14,Bethesda Game Studios &amp; Obsidian are both owned by Microsoft; it'd be great go see the two work together to develop a New Vegas sequel.,1601490695,"It's not complicated as one might think, just recently id Software &amp; Avalanche Studios worked together to develop Rage 2; although that didn't turn out well BUT id Software delivered with their authentic and excellent Combat Mechanics. 

Bethesda did a great job with modernisation of the Fallout series:

- Companions
- Crafting System
- Combat System
- Graphical Overhaul
- Settlement System

And I really don't have to tell anyone how great Bethesda is at World Building.

Obsidian does not run away from OG Fallout Lore, we saw that with New Vegas. There were so many references to the old games and personally I learned much more about the Fallout World than I did with Fallout 4.

Obsidian WILL deliver with:

- Lore
- Story
- Characters
- Dialogue 
- Quests

Although many people who worked on Fallout: New Vegas have left Obsidian BUT the project director &amp; lead designer of Fallout: New Vegas is still at Obsidian, Josh Sawyer. 

You may still ask why not just Obsidian? Well, how long do you think we have to wait for a new Fallout game; BGS is working on Starfield and Obsidian on DLC for The Outer Worlds?

Both were large side quests and both teased the existence of a larger world and powerful entities outside the current map. 

Larger World: 

* Fallout 3 teased the Commonwealth,
* Lorenzo's story teases the existence of a buried ancient civilization that was discovered somewhere in the middle east. Granted it's not very convenient geographically speaking, but there's no reason why such a powerful civilization wouldn't have expanded across the entire planet, with ruins buried deep beneath the rocky mountains or the sands of New Mexico (for example) and unearthed by nuclear explosions. In addition, other pieces of content in both F3 and F4 already hint at the presence of that civilization in north America. 

Powerful enemies:

* Fallout 3 teased the existence of a highly advanced society capable of creating artificial humans and with the resources to hunt them down hundreds of miles away were they to escape. Those synths hunters turned out to work for The Institute. 
* Lorenzo's story introduces us to a family of immortals whose patriarch is a mind controlling super human who managed to tap into untold powers. Sure, you can ""kill"" Lorenzo in Fallout 4 ... but what does death mean to someone who messed with Cosmic horrors?

The last argument why it could, is that a lot of traditional villains have already been explored in the previous games. Mutant army, Genocidal government (x2), Imperialistic democracy, Tyranny, Mad scientist/billionaire, Robot uprising (If you consider Fallout tactics), Synthetic domination, Deadly Sentient Virus, ""Dragons"" (Scorch beasts) ... which kind of leave aliens, cosmic horror and, maybe, a ghoul uprising, as unexplored ideas.

0,[Fallout 4] I can't decide which faction I want to join! Help?,1601413888,"I know, I know. This post probably is like spam at this point on this sub. But it's a moral quandary I'm in. Every faction has some inherent ""good side"" to them but also a weakness. 

 **The Brotherhood of Steel**: They are ordered and possess the ability to protect plenty of citizens of the Commonwealth simply because of their power armor and weaponry. They do seem like they could help the most people, but they're very radical. I mean, Maxson sees Synths as abominations, super mutants as abominations (I don't disagree with him there) and basically wants a pure and safe Commonwealth. Not a bad idea, right? Well it would be if they didn't also hate the Railroad for some reason. It's not like The Railroad are producing Synths. They simply want to protect the ones that want to be free. But that isn't allowed in Maxson's Commonwealth, and many other BOS members share that sentiment. 

 **The Railroad**: While I think any free Synth has the right to live if they so choose, the Railroad as an organization are a bit too shortsighted in my opinion. Their only mission is to protect and save Synths. That's it. Not help the people of the Commonwealth or build a better world, just save Synths. Again, very shortsighted in my opinion. 

**The Minutemen**: They seem to be the most moral faction thus far, wanting to help settlers and make the Commonwealth a better place. But they are extremely underarmed and stretched very thin. Sure, they could make more bases around the Commonwealth, but who's going to man them? Who's supplying the ammo and food to keep the men and women stocked? They don't seem to be able to answer this question yet. 

**The Institute**: This one really isn't even a choice. I mean sure, they have the technology and capability to help many many people, but they just won't. They'd rather just preserve their way of life and let the problems of the Commonwealth sort itself out while they continue their work. Sure, that could all change with you as the director. But do you really think everyone's going to be onboard with you? Also, child kidnappings and what they did to Virgil. To say that's cruel is an understatement.

3,This is what the next Fallout Game should be,1601412277,"So I've posted this idea only twice in the comments section and I wanted to get a wider feedback on the idea and see what most of you think. Since I see so many ideas being thrown out there.

The next Fallout game should not be Fallout 5. It should be a spinoff. Now hear me out.

Picture this. A Linear RPG spinoff.

 Instead of a vault dweller, a colonist for a trading company in the NCR is aboard a ship and on its way to a newly Annexed State of Alaska. He/she is sent as a liason for the Company to established a new International Trading Route with the Asian Continent. The Bering Strait becomes the new Silk Road essentially.

However, Alaska is not as peaceful or as cracked up as he might think. The people of Alaska are remnants of people that lived in China. New friends and enemies are made as companies, scavvers, raiders, and people of Alaska fight for who controls the new Silk Road. The only thing that could throw a wrench in everyone's plans is old enemy that had been long forgotten. One that survived the destruction of an off shore Oil Rig. 

Another  option was to have someone from Project Purity sail to some part of  England or France. I don't have a narrative for this yet.

All in all the point of this spinoff RPG in the Fallout Universe would be to open up some possibilities for future games outside of America. This would allow a Fallout 5 or 6 to be introduced in this way and not be as jarring to its audience. This would expand the Fallout Universe even more and create a ton of possibilities for where the Franchise is now.

Maybe as you level up you can pick abilities to help you better build your settlement, and maybe your settlement keeps growing in size as you level up, and you can build radio towers that bring in more settlers to help you defend your settlement. Maybe individual settlers can level up too and you can pick new abilities for them (like make one have a higher science skill and give that settler use laser weapons).

The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
""He's an outlaw loose and runnin'"", came a whisper from each lip
""And he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip""
""Big iron on his hip""
In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more
Now the stranger started talkin' made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He was here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red
Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry, men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
Now the morning passed so quickly it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
Folks were watchin' from the windows
Every body held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
About to meet his death
There was twenty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather for a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered 'round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin' but he made one fatal slip

21,(FO5) A propsal on what Fallout 5 could be,1601310390,"   
  Fallout 5 takes place in the lower Peninsula of Michigan now referred to as only ""The Peninsula"" 20 years after Fallout 4 takes place. The nuclear war has taken its toll on this region. It is a tundra wasteland with radiation blizzards that make it nearly inhospitable. To make matters worse it is being invaded by a group calling themselves ""The Kleptocrats"" who have already taken control of the Upper Peninsula are trying to invade the Lower Peninsula. You are the one known as ""The Exiled One"" You were exiled from Vault 123. An obscure but working vault concept where only families with newborn children were allowed in. The parents were killed and the children were raised by robots and lead to believe that there is nothing outside the vault and that the vault was the world. You attempt to lead a coup against the Overseer (the messianic figure in the minds of the vault residents) only to find out that he is on the top floor of the facility then you are ""fed"" as a sacrifice to the elevator that is remote operated by the overseer. You are then kicked out of the vault and left to roam the Peninsula. Throughout the game you are being hunted by the Kleptocrats and their soldiers. You don't know why but you join up with one of 4 factions in order to kick them out of the Lower Peninsula and send them back to the Upper Peninsula where they have almost complete control. Faction one is known as the Egoists, a faction inspired by the teachings of Max Sternier. They serve as the indestructible ""Yes man faction"" since they are only united by their ideology. You cannot destoy them because they have no leader and their faction represents an idea. The second faction you can join is called the Remnant, this faction composes the surviving members of The Enclave and they are the most directly confrontational toward the Kleptocrats. The third is the Oathkeepers, a group of scientists and doctors trying to cure the New Plague which has ravenged the Upper Peninsula, giving the Kleptocrats almost complete control there since they are the only ones who possess a known temporary treatment to the New Plague. And the final is the Brotherhood, who is in the Peninsulas in order to wipe out the Remnant and the Kleptocrats, along with containing the New Plague and the people of The Peninsulas so they don't leave and spread the virus. As you try to push out the Kleptocrats you learn more about who they really are and once you get to their main base in the Lower Peninsula (an old military installation) you are given the chance to join them and learn who they really are. The Kleptocrats are ex-members of the Enclave who grew disenfranchised with the way the Enclave went about the cleanup. So the Kleptocrats split from the Enclave after it was destroyed and moved their operation to the Upper Peninsula. The Kleptocrats believe no direct action has to be taken against the people of the wasteland, no major genocide needs to be enacted to purify the United States. Rather that they can be lead to their own destruction by their instincts alone. The Kleptocrats use this treatment to the new plague to get wastelanders to submit to them by using the treatment to the New Plague as leverage against them, forcing them to destroy their former friends and allies and do their bidding. If they refuse, their commands and missions they are left to die. At one point ""The Boss"" of the Kleptocrats quotes Sun Tzu by stating "" The opportunity to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself."" The Kleptocrats' base in the Lower Peninsula can be destroyed ending the main game campaign causing them to cut their losses and cease their campaign in the Lower Peninsula.   
  Now for the DLC. As you have read the Kleptocrats main base known as the Ivory tower is in the Upper Pennisula meaning you have to travel there to finish them off for good. Unless you decided to slide with them, then you are there to wipe out settlements and civilians who oppose the Kleptocrats. On arrival you find a dying society where the infection is killing everyone but the Kleptocrats and those who have chosen to collaborate with the Kleptocrats. This means that all the Kleptocrat troops you mowed down were simply trying to get temporary treatment for the New Plague The DLC story progresses as such, The Egoists and the Brotherhood are there to destroy the Kleptocrats. While the Oathkeepers are interested in capturing the Ivory Tower so that they can syntheize the treatment and work on a cure to save Upper Pennisula. As in the original Fallout game, your time is limited and if you don't act quickly more and more rebellious settlemtents will die out leaving only the Kleptocrats and their collaborators left alive. Making it so you have no choice but to destroy the Kleptocrats and take their treatment to an essential scientist npc or the Oathkeepers You uncover when infiltrating the Ivory Tower the Kleptocrats biggest secret. They own a powerful piece of pre-war tech, the Innsbruck. This ship was a failed U.S. teleportation experiment that caused the crew to fuse with the ship and travel through time with the technology. The Kleptocrats discovered the ship and reversed engineered the time travel device, making a micro version of it they use to travel into the future and even the past. When you confront the Boss face to face. He offers to transport you back intime to before the war, a lie by the way. You are actually transported back to Vault 123 where the Kleptocrats' soldiers are slaughtering the vault. You than then go back and finish off or capture the Ivory Tower ending the Kleptocrats once and for all. The true reason they want to destroy you is because they sent their agent inside the time travel device and saw you destroy the Ivory Tower.   
  A few new game mechanics. You can capture settlements for your faction by clearing out or intimating and demanding tribute from the settlers the same way you do in Nuka World. Every faction has this ability. And all you need to do to take a settlement is to either threaten them via charisma check or kill the settlers and place a flag indicating your faction controls the area. Dissimilar to Nuka World, you can do this without having to do a quest and can do this to almost every settlement. Settlements are marked in terms of which faction controls them and settlements of destroyed factions become rogue, prime for conquest. Raiders can also capture settlements. The more settlements you have, the more allies you can summon by using a distress device such as a flare gun. Another one would be an approval bar above the heads of companions, the higher the bar, the better relationship status you have with the companion. On the Pip-Boy, Faction approval is also marked. It will stay stagnant unless you do something to upset them, such as taking their settlements, acts of aggression, or taking certain quests from other factions, this disapproval will show via reminder when you are about to engage or have engaged in such behavior on the side then it will lower (The Egoists are the only faction who are not subjected to this system, the Egoist companion is also a blank slate, not caring about what you do) The Egoists do not care because you are acting in your own interest. There is also to be a feature where you will be told via the notification side of the screen about how many junk items you need to craft a marked item. In FO5 you will be able to mark a mod for crafting automatically unmarking the resources you have enough of in order to create it,   
  For the DLC by the way, you will be notified on the side when a settlement ""dies out""

25,What do you guys think of my idea of an enemy?,1601308638,"The Appalachian Wildmen serve no one and are secluded people who typically keep to themselves. They can be found amuck the forests of Appalachia but are extremely dangerous when encountered. Unlike other foes, they prefer to use stealth tactics and have an insanely high perception. They know the lands better than anyone and are equipped with some gear usually made from hide that comes from a variety of animals, usually modified to help them keep a low profile and blend in with the wilderness. There are scripted encounters where they lay an ambush on one of the main roads, and a player can be ambushed by one. Sometimes there are groups of Wildmen working together, but it’s a rare encounter. 

Variants

Wildmen can be found anywhere where there is a forest, with the most popular regions being The Forest and The Savage Divide. Two different variants of Wildmen are within The Mire and Cranberry Bog and are called Swampmen and Bogmen. 

Swampmen

Swampmen are usually found near or in rivers and ponds. They typically lie in wait for someone to pass by, then attack them relentlessly with a melee weapon. Should the person get too far when under attack, they take out a shotgun and charge at the target while shooting. Once they get close enough again, they will continue using melee attacks which can stagger opponents consistently. What they use to hide themselves is a ghillie suit covered in vines and moss in order to conceal themselves in the water, using a special breathing apparatus that allows them to stay submerged for long periods of time. They are very high level and a major threat should they get close. A specialty that Swampmen have is the “War Cry” ability, which gives a -25% armor debuff and is used right after they run out of the water to ambush their target, lasting for around 1 minute. The war cry itself isn’t really a cry but a scream, that is amplified by the apparatus they where to make it sound more akin to the Aztec Death Whistle. In case you don’t know what that sounds like: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9QuO09z-SI&amp;t=0m51s .Should they reach the 50% health point, they will instead initiate a high frequency noise that will debuff perception by 2 and slightly blur vision. The tool is typically used on Mirelurks in order to stun them somewhat, but can be tuned to a pitch to affect humans as well. 

Bogmen

Bogmen rises in the Cranberry Bog and can be encountered near areas where the brush is high or have trees. They typically like to fire at their targets stealthily using high calibre sniper rifles with a unique suppressor that makes almost no noise. The gear they wear helps them stay hidden from scorched and scorchedbeasts, while also protecting them from the plague. They will typically aim for the head and limbs of a character. Should you get close enough, however, they will take out a Scorchbeast knife tooth and charge at the player and attack furiously. The ability they have is the “Bloodrage” ability, making them more and more aggressive as they lose health. They gain an initial 5% attack speed and damage boost, and max out at 30% attack speed and damage boost. Before they attack you, they will attempt to cripple you by targeting your legs and firing at them in order to prevent you from running, making you an easy target to pick off.

A quick Google search turns up a ton of inconsistent responses, and none of them seem to have any evidence. The things that I see most commonly said to affect run speed are:

* Agility stat
* Endurance stat
* Total carry weight
* (Current carry weight) / (Total carry weight)
* Weight of all equipped weapons and armor
* Weight of currently raised weapon

Has anyone ever figured out exactly what the run speed formula is in Fallout 3 or any other Bethesda Fallout/Elder Scrolls game? Is there someone you can see it in the GECK/Creation Kit?

I think there are a few reasons, in skyrim you get so many quests from just going to a new town as people will run up to you or guards will give you info. The only thing i can think of in F4 like this is entering diamond city. Also, Skyrim makes looting and killing hard enemies rewarding with unique apparel and weapons whereas in fallout, it feels like the same weapons or armour but sometimes you feel rewarded due to a unique perk. Nothing looks unique and I never felt badass like i do in Skyrim and even older fallouts. I think what shows this is that I never even wanted to go third person like I did in those other games so I could see my character. I want to love F4 because I think it does factions greatly, much better than skyrim as you must pick between conflicting factions.

Items?

What do you think people aren't talking about but should be? Personally I think the Fallout's horror influences are superb. The blend of the ""end of the world"" and ""fear of the unknown"" and ""dread"" together uniquely create a lot of subtle but interesting horror elements throughout the series. From the Necropolis from Fallout 1 to the Lonesome Road's bleakness to Far Harbors obvious Lovecraft influenced themes. I think the game does a great job of be horrfic without the need for jumpscares (aside from the Spore carrier from Vault 22)

Addtionally I think Fallouts portrayal of drugs and alcohol is surprisingly pretty good. Characters use for fun, to cope, to relax, some people over-do it, some people don't, there are folks that see it as a business, some people see it a vice. It's a very mature understanding of drugs and i don't see many games treating drugs and alcohol with any amount of nuance.",Fallout,booster_silver,False,/r/Fallout/comments/j10sc0/what_are_in_your_opinion_the_underrated/

88,(FO5) A Suggestion for Fallout 5's Story,1601237253,"Fallout 5 takes place in the lower Peninsula of Michigan now referred to as only ""The Peninsula""  20 years after Fallout 4 takes place. The nuclear war has taken its toll on this region. It is a tundra wasteland with irradiated blizzards and green snow that make it nearly inhospitable. To make matters worse it is being invaded by a group calling themselves ""The Kleptocrats"" who have already taken control of the Upper Peninsula are trying to invade the Lower Peninsula. You are the one known as ""The Exiled One"" You were exiled from Vault 123. An obscure but working vault concept where only familes with newborn children were allowed in. The parents were killed and the children were raised by robots and lead to believe that there is nothing outside the vault. You attempt to lead a coup against the Overseer (the messianic figure in the minds of the vault residents) only to find out that he is on the top floor of the facility then you are ""fed"" as a sacrifice to the elevator that is remote operated by the overseer. You are then kicked out of the vault and left to roam the Peninsula. Throughout the game you are being hunted by the Kleptocrats and their soldiers. You don't know why but you join up with one of 4 factions in order to kick them out of the Lower Peninsula and send them back to the Upper Peninsula where they have almost complete control. Faction one is known as the Egoists, a faction inspired by the teachings of Max Sternier. They serve as the indestructible ""Yes man faction"" since they are only united by their ideology. You cannot destoy them because they have no leader and their faction represents an idea. The second faction you can join is called the Remnant, this faction composes the surviving members of The Enclave and they are the most directly confrontational toward the Kleptocrats. The third is the Oathkeepers, a group of scientists and doctors trying to cure the New Plague which has revenged the Upper Peninsula, giving the Kleptocrats almost complete control there since they are the only ones who possess a known cure to the New Plague. And the final is the Brotherhood, who is in the Peninsulas in order to wipe out the Remnant and the Kleptocrats, along with containing the New Plague and the people of The Peninsulas so they don't leave and spread the virus. As you try to push out the Kleptocrats you learn more about who they really are and once you get to their main base in the Lower Peninsula (an old military installation) you are given the chance to join them and learn who they really are. The Kleptocrats are ex-members of the Enclave who grew disenfranchised with the way the Enclave went about the cleanup. So the Kleptocrats split from the Enclave after it was destroyed and moved their operation to the Upper Peninsula.  The Kleptocrats believe no direct action has to be taken against the people of the wasteland, no major genocide needs to be enacted to purify the United States. Rather that they can be lead to their own destruction by their instincts alone. The Kleptocrats use resources and caps to get wastelanders to submit to them by bribery or extortion, forcing them to  destroy their former friends and allies. If they refuse, their resources are taken away and they are left to die. At one point ""The Boss"" of the Kleptocrats quotes Sun Tzu by stating "" The opportunity to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself."" The Kleptocrats' base in the Lower Peninsula can be destroyed ending the main game campaign causing them to cut their losses and cease their campaign in the Lower Peninsula. 

Now for the DLC. As you have read the Kleptocrats main base known as the Ivory tower is in the Upper Pennisula meaning you have to travel there to finish them off for good. On arrival you find a dying society where the infection is killing everyone but the Kleptocrats and their troops, this is because the Kleptocrats are the only ones offering a cure. In exchange the people are forced to be implanted with a brain chip and serve in the Kleptocrats' army. This means that the majority of the people you had mowed down in the main game were fighting you for the survival of their famlies. Arriving here you are hated for your actions, finding you have destroyed many families. Most civilians are outright verballly hostile to you for this, unless you join the Kleptocrats in which case they fear you. The DLC story progresses as such, The Egoists and the Brotherhood are there to destroy the Kleptocrats. While the Oathkeepers are interested in  capturing the Ivory Tower so that they can syntheize the cure and save the Upper Pennisula. As in the original Fallout game, your time is limited and if you don't act quickly the entire Upper Pennisula will die out leaving only Super Mutants and the Kleptocrats alive. You uncover when infitrating the Ivory Tower that the reason the Kleptocrats were hunting you at first was because they own a powerful piece of pre-war tech, the Innsbruck. This ship was a failed U.S. teleportation experiment that caused the crew to fuse with the ship and travel through time with the technology. The Kleptocrats discovered the ship and reversed engineered the time travel device, making a micro version of it they use to travel into the future and even the past. When you confront the Boss face to face. He offers to transport you back intime to before the war, a lie by the way. You are actually transported back to Vault 123 where the Kleptocrats soldiers are slaughtering the vault. You than then go back and finish off or capture the Ivory Tower ending the Kleptocrats once and for all.

&amp;#x200B;

A few new game mechanics. You can capture settlements for your faction by clearing out or intimating and demanding tribute from the settlers the same way you do in Nuka World. Every faction has this ability. And all you need to do to take a settlement is to either threaten them via charisma check or kill the settlers and place a flag indicating your faction controls the area. Dissimilar to Nuka World, you can do this without having to do a quest and can do this to almost every settlement.  Settlements are marked in terms of which faction controls them and settlements of destroyed factions become rogue, prime for conquest. Raiders can also capture settlements. The more settlements you have, the more allies you can summon by using a distress device such as a flare gun.

Another one would be an approval bar above the heads of companions, the higher the bar, the better relationship status you have with the companion. On the Pip-Boy, Faction approval is also marked. It will stay stagnant unless you do something to upset them, such as taking their settlements, acts of aggression, or taking certain quests from other factions, this disapproval will show via reminder when you are about to engage or have engaged in such behavior on the side then it will lower (The Egoists are the only faction who are not subjected to this system, the Egoist companion is also a blank slate, not caring about what you do) The Egoists do not care because you are acting in your own interest. There is also to be a feature where you will be told via the notification side of the screen about how many junk items you need to craft a marked item. In FO5 you will be able to mark a mod for crafting automatically unmarking the resources you have enough of in order to create it,

Nick Valentine is an amazing character but having him and side quest to keep up the noir theming is plain cruel.

5,"My opinion of fallout 3,nv and 4",1601224867," 

Hey all, so i just finished playing all modern fallouts, plus watched fallout 1 and 2 full gameplay with all choices shown (i always fell asleep watching 2, but i got a solid idea of what it was)

Anyways, I must first confess, my fov of all the Fallout games is Fallout 4, because the gameplay loop is just amazing, the shooting, exploration, the map, it all just feels good, plus the mod pushes it into legendary status (like skyrim). I will also admit, i don't like the wild west theme, i hate it, yet i decided to push through NV, and enjoyed it.

moving on:

Fallout 3 felt a lot like oblivion, it was fun, enjoyable, but nothing compared to Fallout 1 imo. That is, Fallout 3 is trying to simulate fallout 1 wasteland with an anarchic environment and no strong factions to enforce rules. it wasn't bad, it was alright. just, not as series, not as gritty, but that's a problem with all the modern fallout games. 7/10

fallout NV: i will profess, i never wanted it to play it, but everyone online praises it as the golden apple of eden. Now, me disliking the wild west theme coupled with the janky combat u would think i would hate it, but no... i loved the story and writing, but everything else imo falls short. the map is HUGE and empty, running between objectives is just boring, i had to use sgtm command to speed it up. I loved the factions of vegas quests,  they were really fun and immersive. helping out the ghouls in come fly with me was enjoyable, if you don't count the running. I personally am not a fan of fixed speech checks, I think it turns from something that is supposed to be dynamic in nature and risky to feel like another skill... I'm aware it was made to stop the quick save quick load abuse, but I aint convinced, speech needs to be fluid and risky not a fixed number. so yeah, it was fun, writing and story really good, everything else was meh... BROWN/10 (seriesly tho its a 7/10)

fallout 4 was fun all around experience for me, the gameplay is superb, enjoyed the story and quests (i'm not a big RP guy, and usually stick with the narrative favored or pointed towards by devs)

The world and map is beautiful to explore and discover any of the hidden stories. i enjoyed the companions (NICk and DANSE), i do hate that the ending is not as fleshed out, but i appreciate letting me continue after the end ""slides'' (if you can call them that lol) (9/10) it's the highest because the most important part for me (the gameplay and exploration) is best.

finally when it comes to fo1 and 2, i though 1 was better felt more fallouty than the secound, even though 2 has a better main story, i juist felt like the world of FO1 was more series dark and immersive, all the oranized crime, drugs and sex in 2 makes it, i dont know, not to my liking.

I'd rather be the next obsidian fallout game be in another major us state like new york  now thats the perfect setting for a post apocalyptic game, imagine manhattan ruins, skeletons of buildings everywhere with that dark and depressing ambience.

Then 76 does the exact same thing with more rehashed fallout 3 music and some tracks from 4. I can't even listen to the radio now. 
If I do in 76 I end up pressing it, hear butcher Pete for the 10000th time and it goes straight back off, only rarely am I treated to those great new ones. I keep having to switch it off for a few songs.

There was a great thing that the mod Fallout New California did and its stuck with me ever since. They had an NCR Radio station where the DJ would actually elaborate on how the track was found and it added such depth to the radio. I think he talks about how the holotape was found by a ranger in a burnt out car. Such a great way to add music

32,Fallout 3 Pint Lookout Discussion,1601184220,"I was wondering what the community thought of fallout 3’s Point Lookout dlc. I understand fallout 3 is somewhat controversial and some would say not a true fallout (at least before 76 came out), because of its lackluster story, dialogue, and gameplay. But I feel like many of the problems with the linearity of the main quest line were somewhat remedied by the quest line in Point Lookout.

I believe that Point Lookout is an excellent dlc and has one of the best main quest lines of any fallout dlc, along with excellent side quests, a very nice new area to explore, interesting new enemies and weapons, and an experience not found anywhere else in fallout 3. My one and only problem with point lookout is that it is too short, likely because it’s just a dlc. If it had just one or two more quests I would say it’s perfect.

I have been somewhat active in the fallout community and have not heard any mention of point lookout any time recently. And I was wondering if there was a negative opinion around the dlc.

42,(SPOILERS) My Faction Choices and Why,1601171583,"Ok, so I play Xbox One, and Id like to make a psa about valuable info involved with which route I take with factions and why. This information is not readily available anywhere obvious when googling endings to decide from, so this may help people find their ultimate playthrough.

First off, ALWAYS DO NUKAWORLD FIRST and get Gages perk and Raider Outposts perk before you even enter the museum of freedom. This way you can still help Minutemen and get Prestons perk. If gages final perk speach bugs out after completing Nuka World, have him as a follower, save outside museum of freedom, enter the museum of freedom with Gage, kill the raiders on the first floor ONLY, then exit the museum of freedom. This has triggered Gages final alignment speech more than once for me.

Now, let me start with an opinion on Ballistic Weave. It is unrealistically overpowered and cheesey. Ok, now I start tradecraft, get the deliverer and keep carringtons prototype for myself. Then, find the institute after becoming allied with both BOS and Minutemen and getting Danse and Garvy perks. Complete mankind redefined, failing tradecraft, do plugging a leak to get Liam's Glasses, probably the only eyewear with a special bonuses, one of which being 2 int so more XP. 

Institute destroys railroad and BOS, so murder and loot both places thoroughly. Institute also has the better rewards, power armor paint, teleport, synth grenades, plus many more synths to find around so much better chance at finding full heavy synth armor. Minutemen just feels more goodguy and leaves railroad alone only, killing BOS and Institute, which is pointless because youve already given up ballistic weave, the only great thing the RR has to give you.

Now you have a pair of intelligence glasses that alot of players dont even know exist, every follower perk besides Deacons perk, Gage and Garvey remain allied followers, new power armor paint and teleport for survival, minutemen and institute remain allied, heavy synth armor, alllll at the cost of Ballistic Weave, Deacon, and a very small portion of your soul!

Hawaii and Atlanta were excluded due to lack of info. People say they like the idea but no one gives ideas about it, even in the posts dedicated to them. I excluded Australia, London and China for the same reasons but also because they tend to not be favored in this sub.

1) Install Fallout 3

2) The game will simply not open. After a bit of searching you'll find this is because you need GFWL (Games For Windows Live) installed.

3) Download the GFWL installer and there will be no network connection -- Installation will fail.

4) Get excited when you see there's a GFWL disabler.

5) Find out that you need to have run the game and have an existing fallout3.ini file to run the disabler.

6) Create an empty .ini file to trick the app into recognising the .ini file. 

7) Successfully ""Disable GFWL""

8) Double-click Fallout3.exe (or FOSE_loader), pulse rate increasing at the sight of a black window... 

9) Nothing

62,"First time playing Fallout New Vegas, looking for some advice!",1601148691,"As someone who absolutely loves the entire concept of the Fallout games, I've always found it very difficult to get far into the games because of the difficulty. I've played New Vegas years ago and have played a bit of Fallout 3, which I really enjoyed because it reminded me a lot of Skyrim, but again I never made it too far into both games. I think the difficulty is what keeps me from getting too far. Both times I only make it just outside of the starting towns and then end up dying too much and losing interest. 

So last night I tried getting into Fallout New Vegas for the first time on PC (having tried it on Xbox before) and found myself once again killed by a scorpion just outside of Goodsprings 20 minutes into the game. For some reason my aim is basically garbage (playing with an Xbox controller from the couch) and even with VATs I couldn't kill the thing. I'm actually not terrible when it comes to FPS games like CSGO, Overwatch etc but for some reason with Fallout I can't kill anything!

I guess what I'm asking is, how can I ""customize"" my character/the game so I can actually play it and enjoy the story, the setting and everything it has to offer? I love RPGs but I'm not a huge fan of quickpaced, overwhelming gun combat. I think that's why I enjoyed Skyrim so much, I was always melee and almost never died! Whereas in Fallout I get really freaked out by vermins and enemies coming at me/shooting at me and having to shoot them from afar. I tried going for a melee build but I feel like the game wants me to use guns early on, with the training with Sunny and everything. Am I wrong? 

One last thing - I'm considering switching from Normal to Easy or Very Easy difficulty. Any recommendations on what's best?

97,What makes a good fallout quest part 3,1601115082,"This is part 3 of what i think im my opinion makes a good fallout game sorry for any errors and if its to long.

Followers are unique to the fallout games fallout NV had some of the best companions in the fallout series fallout 4 was second best excep for nick valentine who by far is in my opinion the best followers in the sense of story not strength and health thats what i think makes good companions in fallout a good story and a quest that changes they way that they might think and feel and you helping them make a decision on what they think is the right path for them like helping raul in fallout nv deciding on if he should pick up his guns again in fallout 4 the companions were changed so you could have relationships with them and comparing to fallout 3 companions bethesda did a great job improving them if for the next fallout game they could put in the idea of companions from fallout nv with their emotions and decisions at the end of their quest with fallout 4 and its relationship options might make companions better.

Story in fallout bethesda games feels like a common thing fallout 3 your dad goes missing follow in his steps to find him fallout 4 your son goes missing follow in his kidnappers footsteps to find him fallout 76 find the overseer and follow in her footsteps in NV its you getting shot and following in the footsteps of the person who tried to kill you and getting caught up in a war for the hover dam to be far this kinda happens in fallout 4 with the institute but it kinda feels all the same i feel that they should start your story with your character entering a new land with your character having no past and working your way up to a main story i cant think of a new story they could do i just wish for somthing different.

Factions in fallout have alwats been a thing in fallout 3 and 4 the brotherhood of steel is the most powerful army you could possibly find and are part of the main story in the sense that you need to have the brotherhood of steel help you defeat the enclave and institute but fallout 4kinda changed this with different endings but i want factions that dont really become invloved in the main story like the followers of the apocalypse i want factions like those but i also would like an entire new faction that originated from other factions like if a new army was formed from some NCR deserters but those are just my opinions on factions

22,Fallout 76 is a MISERABLE Grind,1601083305,"I'm writing this post for all of the people who ask every other day on here if Fallout 76 is worth trying.

The bugs? Sure, they are still there, but not too bad anymore. The quests? Wastelanders is pretty damn fun and the story is well written. Graphics? Actually pretty decent and the game runs fairly well (with a bit of lag at least on PS4 Pro though). 

BUT MY GOD, I hate the grind of this game. Your weapons break every five minutes (at least it feels like that), your armor breaks way way faster than any previous Fallout, and you are CONSTANTLY thirsty or hungry. 
And, assuming you haven't played it yet, you will say ""oh well just loot around the world"" -- no, they have reduced the amount of loot in the game (ammo, food, health packs, etc.). It costs caps to even fast travel or move your camp. EVERYTHING is meant to increase the grind in this game and encourage microtransactions. 

I hate this grind. No, I do not enjoy Bethesda forcing us into these survival elements. Before, these survival elements were always an option for us more casual players; now, they're forced on us.

Also Spoilers for Fallout 1, 2, NV
Oh, and this is my opinion so Downnvote if you feel like it's shit, comment why you think I'm wrong, and whatever else you wanna say. Or upvote if you want it to be heard, idc

Fallout NV2 is the worst idea. In fact, any Fallout game (at least with multiple choices) taking place in the same map as a previous game is terrible. 
First off, it kills that illusion of choice. We don't know much what happened in the end of NV, nothing says what endings were 100% cannon, so we feel like maybe our ending was the proper one. 
In Fallout 2, the NCR, Military Base, and Vault 13 are all previously from Fallout 1, but there's a reason I ""allow"" that (Like I have a say in what can and can't be Fallout lmao) 

In Fallout 1, they don't tell you what happens to your Vault, and every ending but the Mutant ending is kinda canon. The BoS, Necropolis, and such are never mentioned. (Correct me anytime if I'm wrong)
The NCR and saving Tandi are probably the only two things cannon. 
Whatever, my point is that the endings are mostly vague on what's cannon, so your play through of the next game can be sort of a continuation of the previous Fallout. 

In a ""New Vegas 2"" I'm assuming we'd be in the Mojave again playing as say, ""The Warrior"" (idk I'm not a team of writers and I'm doing this as a placeholder) a tribal who's looking to make some money for his tribe to survive. (Not bad if you think about building a settlement town) 
He wanders the exact same map running into the Post NV factions. Maybe, the Neo Legionaries, Greater Kahns, the super imperialist NCR, and the sinless, no gambling New New Vegas. Maybe the main idea is corruption of non democratically elected power. Cool story, cool ideas, but it ain't working.
It'd kill the emerson of: This is the world I, the courier, created. I defeated the legion, I helped Jacobstown, and I liberated New Vegas, etc, etc. 
Not only that, but wouldn't wandering the same map feel a little boring? A remake is one thing, but revisiting... nah.

33,So hey the Great Khans should be the focus of the next Fallout,1601075651,"Ok so I know nothing is set in stone but with all the dust stirred up by the deal with Microsoft and renewed hope in another Obsidian Fallout, I figured I’d throw my loose ideas out there. 

The Great Khans have SO much potential to be a major faction after one of their endings in NV. And yes I think they should establish canon endings. Keeping it obscure works for TES because of the weird ass metaphysical background it has but I feel like Fallout’s setting absolutely needs to progress the world and story. But the Legion is going to collapse without Caesar no matter what. That’s gonna create a massive power vacuum that a burgeoning large scale raider faction can fill. The idea of the Khans carving out a brutal empire on the plains like their namesake is just beautiful to me. They could easily take over northern legion territory. If they got a foothold in the region the NCR would have a much bigger threat across the Colorado this time. 

So the setup is basically the aftermath caused in southern Colorado, northern New Mexico, and Texas by Caesar’s death. He survived New Vegas but his worsening health and the stress of his absolute failure wore on him and he kicked the bucket. The Legion splintered just like Rome and was divided into factions while the NCR runs back to their territory to lick their wounds after Vegas became independent. The Khans migrate northeast away from their biggest threats and easily steam roll the raider gangs. And the leadership took a page from Caesar’s book. Not just wiping out their enemies but integrating their tribes into their own and teaching them their ways. 

Years later the Khans are the dominant power in the region. The NCR learned it’s lesson after overextending into Nevada and have moved focus to consolidating power in their established territory and slowly pressing north up the coast. Legion territory has degenerated into constantly shifting borders of the splinter factions and bloody skirmishes between the legate warlords. As the Khans push south the threat of them establishing a foothold that could put them in a position to take the Southwest is a rising threat that the NCR wants to prevent. Instead of trying to force their borders East to meet the Khans in open war, they station ranger outposts far beyond their reach to operate independently towards the goal of undermining rapid Khan expansion. 


The NCR as a whole won’t be a major faction in the game. You’d only interact with one of these outposts doing missions for and with the spec ops rangers there. Working against the Khans and even helping strengthen the local raider gangs and Legion remnant factions in the area to help oppose the new major enemy and serve as a buffer between NCR and Khan land. Basically the NCR’s equivalent of the Cold War. 


Or on the other side you could help the Khans conquer the region by either beating down the smaller factions or uniting them under a Khan banner. And the individual raider gangs need to be truly fleshed out. Fallout 4 took a good step in that direction but you need to actually be able to interact with them in ways outside combat. Some aren’t immediately hostile to everything that moves and are open to diplomacy or making deals. Others are traditional raiders but may have a mission you can discover that makes them warm up to you or you can find a very specific bargaining chip for their specific culture.",Fallout,Brahmus168,False,/r/Fallout/comments/izucut/so_hey_the_great_khans_should_be_the_focus_of_the/

40,"Nearly 5 years after Fallout 4's launch and on the heels of the announcement of Bethesda's acquisition, got my 100% on Xbox today! Some notes from the field and a couple words of half-wisdom for those still trying.",1601070741,"[Proof and Stats for those interested.](https://imgur.com/a/t8KuJRw)

I've done it, friends. 89 levels into my survival play-through, I completed the final remaining achievement for Fallout 4 on my Xbox One S. As a longtime fan of the series, I couldn't be more proud.

**Top 3 Toughest Achievements**

1. Benevolent Leader - As I understand, this is the one that keeps most Sole Survivors from catching their own 100%. Bethesda keeps too many secrets from us in regards to settlement happiness (like the fact there's no way to make robots happy above 50, or how unassigned settlers aren't happy). The worst part by far is idling to see if your settlement changes even affect the overall happiness.  In the end, it was the 3 incredibly happy settlers of Jamaica Plain that scored the trophy for me. 2 of them worked at restaurants, one farmed, and I stuffed the workshop with excess mutfruit to make up the difference. This one required a fair amount of research.
2. Beverageer - Nuka-Xtreme's recipe being stuck in the wall of the Dry Rock Gulch theater complex hampered my progress. It was only when I found this phenomenon to be somewhat well documented that I learned to spray-n-pray the book right out of its glitched reality. If you're still patching ANYTHING, please patch this one, Bethesda.
3. Eyes on the Prize - 100,000 Nuka-Cade tickets. Some 8,000 from scavenging Nuka World, the other 92 from an unholy abomination of several hoopshots stuck together and on top of eachother. 3 hours of senseless grind and you can have it too.

**Top 3 Most Annoying Bugs**

1. Couldn't complete ""Trouble Brewin"" quest. Keeping buddy the beer-bot for myself wouldn't bring the objective to its rightful end, forced to murder questgiver Rufus Rubins.
2. Unable to confront DiMa about the nuclear launch key in the Far Harbor DLC. Forced to side with the Children of Atom when I would've liked to bring peace to the island.
3. Nuka World Radio station didn't reveal the location of the transit, had to discover the transit myself.

(Combine these with a running total of 23 abrupt in-game crashes, very unsavory conditions for survival mode.)

**4 Hot Tips for Survival and Otherwise**

1. Killing enemies with power armor is a golden opportunity on survival mode. Blast that body, shred the armor of its remaining condition, and walk away with multiple chunks of weightless, valuable power armor. During my final play-through I could end up with dozens at a time before my next visit to a market.
2. During the quest ""Hole in the Wall"" in Vault 81, just keep the cure for yourself if you get hit with the mole rat disease. There's no shame in letting Austin die, Bethesda gave us no other out. If you leave with the infection as I did, your status effect bar will never be clean again. Additionally, leave your companions at the door, they can give you the disease even if you avoid being hit, a detail I overlooked.
3. I'd argue siding with the institute is more useful for survival mode than the BOS, the ability to fast travel to the M.I.T. complex from anywhere in the Commonwealth did me nothing but good. Free medical care, a clean bed, a couple visits to different merchants, and I was outta there.
4. Do ""Diamond City Blues"" ASAP. All the chem fiends out there already know what I'm talking about.

48,"A family-related story could be really good in Fallout, if done right.",1601065303,"I have heard a lot of criticisms over my time in the Fallout community about how Fallout 3 and 4's search for their family relatives was a boring and too personal of a story to be relatable in an RPG. However, I see it as another example of Bethesda's mishaps: A great concpet with charming potential done aboslutely wrong, because of a lack of attention for detail and focus on scope over quality.

What sparked this idea was a thought Joseph Anderson had in his analysis of Fallout 4, where he suggested a path where you would redeem your son and convince him the Institute does not work and is maleficent to the Commonwealth. This would be really great and shows an element of this that could improve Fallout's current formula:

The time we spend with relatives and family and how they are close to us actually makes them an excellent reflection of who we are in a narrative and that is a resource a writer can't waste on a role-playing game. They would be the main reactivity of the main quest: Do they agree with you, whether you are morally accepted or questioned? Or do they part their ways in the end, despising what you are and what you represented for the Wasteland?

Another problem often brought by the community is the lack of relatability and care they have towards the family relative. We have two ways of resolving this: 1- Not making it about their disappearance, rather about their upbringing or how they upbring you into the Wasteland. 2- Integrating perks into story, making it flashback sequences where you learn what you have to learn and develop a relationship with your relative.

I would also like to mention how a concept such as this would tie in with the main themes of Fallout, which I intepret as the constant pursuit of war against your own. The way I phrased leaves it self-explanatory: War blinds so much it can even bring us against our own family. A tragedic approach would be nice, I guess, show the conflict between the love and care you feel for them and the required opposition for survival. Of course, the thematic resolution would be up to the player's choices.

The final note is a little pessimistic, though: Bethesda, with its current writing staff, could never pull this off. I don't see them interested in characters nor themes, rather by world and fun little quirky situations.",Fallout,Naart904,False,/r/Fallout/comments/izr7di/a_familyrelated_story_could_be_really_good_in/

61,What makes a good fallout game part 2,1601051019,"This is part 2 to my opinion on what makes a good fallout game sorry if there are any spelling errors and if its to long

Gameplay now gameplay in fallout nv and 4 were enjoyable and i love them both so much going behind corners to take cover from an incoming missile or sneaking up on an enemy with a knife with these aspects they are so enjoyable that its hard to not like them but their are some things that could be improved like weapon management now in fallout 4 this wasn’t really a problem and to me in NV this wasn’t a problem either but in 76 to me its like i cant go anywhere without my armor or weapons breaking in half after the first 5 minutes of repairing them and sure they did this with power armor in fallout 4 and already in NV but to me i never really used power armor unless i felt like being a giant tank that kills all i see before me but thats just my opinion apart from that other aspexts of gameplay may be used in other arguments because this oart if getting to long but to end it off I thought it was enjoyable in fallout 4, NV and 76 (kinda)

Weapons in the fallout games were always the same just a gun or a knife until NV added in modding this to me was genius having a hunting rifle with a scope extended ammo clip and better bolt is so good this would later be expanded to the next fallout games 4 and 76 games with even more customisation to them but weapons altogether in the fallout games are so good NV had some of the most fun weapons from the katana to the euclid c finder they were all so much fun to use same with 4 and 76 I always wanted a cross bow type weapon in a fallout game and a homemade rifle in fallout NV though i hatted how I couldn’t put attachments onto my unique weapons without using a mod but with 4 and 76 i can mod my unique weapons forever and thats what u think is a good thing that should be used in all fallout games a huge veriety if weapons like in 76 and the ability to mode them.

Leveling in fallout is an iconic moment for everyone maxing out your xp to get the next perk what i think is better between fallout NV,4 and 76 i think NV did it better because in fallout 4 you have to wait until a certain level until you can get the highest perk to hack or lockpick or get the next rank to weapons modding in 76 in did it a little better with just combining cards to make one big hacking or lockpicking card but in NV you can put a certain amount of points into a certain thing like survival or guns which when you do that can open up opportunities for new perks and by leveling them out so you can get the exact amount next time you level up is so good but i also would like the option to choose when i level up like in 76 and 4 because I would like to see the perks that i might be able to get before i chose fallout 4 did this well with a giant poster filled with all the perks that you might soon get in NV it didn’t feel like wow congratulations look at this it felt more like a look there you go in 76 it gas cards that you put into a certain SPECIAL stat rather than a wall of perks with certain perks under a SPECIAL stat i felt like fallout 4 did this the best but if the option of putting in the same leveling they did in NV with hacking, lovkpicking and guns then it might make fallout a little better but thats just my opinion

65,What makes a good fallout game PART 1,1601047085,"Now before i start people might disagree with me on this but this is what i think makes a good fallout game and you can hate on this as much as you want. (sorry for it being to long)

To start off I believe what makes a good fallout game is the world itself and what i mean by that is that i want to feel like im apart of the world itself rather than me being the world i dont want NOC coming up to me saying “oh my god its our saviour” no i want a world where people react in a way where they have heard of me but not directly like in Vew vegas where they say things like i hurd what you did for us rather than in other fallout games where everyone gets down on their knees and sucks your dick for what you have done for the wasteland i dont want that i wanna feel like a person in a world trying to survive rather than a god that people just worship thats how i feel about the world moving on to other stuff 

Settlement building now this is a different idea so bere i go i think on paper it sounds like a good idea but when being used it went down hill kinda fast dont get me wrong i love building bases for my settlers but it felt like there wasn’t enough and bethesda could have done so much more but they didn’t thats why mods are so useful they put things into settlement building that should have been there but weren’t but with the idea of setting up a small trading town in the waste sounds good right and other wastelanders could trade at a market you made that sounds like a good idea right well it is in my opinion thats why i enjoy fallout 76 building a little more than 4 i know what people are going to say that 76 is shit but the building idea in it is better let me explain in 76 you build a base for yourself a home possibly a trading outpost for others while in fallout 4 you have to manage water, food, beds, security and happiness its so stupid that it hurts i just want to build a house in the middle of a forest where sometimes NPC will buy stuff from me and i know you might be able to do this in fallout 4 but it doesn’t feel the same and thats my opinion on settlement building 

Quests are an iconic piece of fallout but in my opinion questing between fallout 4 and NV are for me 50/50 let me explain in 4 i like the quests but i wish their were more unique quest ideas rather than going to a place kill a raider then your done in NV this kinda was different you might do the same thing but at the end depending on what you did could effect the way people react to you with the reputation system example being taking all the bottle caps for yourself after a quest might lead to negative reputation while in 4 the NPC would just tell yku to leave if they could blend the 2 ideas together then it would work i mean sure they added the reputation system into 76 but that changes nothing you gain and lose reputation but they wont kill you if you have minus reputation i mean WTF.

1,"Do You Consider Early TOS Episode Like ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" Canon?",1601494037,"I've been a huge Star Trek fan for a long time, but over the pandemic, it's gotten worse, and I finally have had to admit to myself that I'm a trekkie. Outside of what is in the actual shows though, I don't know hardly anything, so maybe my question is answered in some book, I don't know. I'm a big fan of the episode ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"", but when viewed from the context of the entire Star Trek canon it doesn't make any sense. Earth and the federation, and the entire surrounding area including Romulan, Klingon, Cardassian, etc. territories are far, far away from the edge of the Alpha and Beta quadrants in any direction according to my understanding. The idea that 2260's Starfleet could, or would, have sent a ship to the edge of the galaxy doesn't make any sense in the context of the rules about warp later established. I have no idea how long it would have taken even the Enterprise D to go that far but I would have to guess decades, much less Kirk's much slower enterprise. Obviously, this isn't the writers' fault, there was no canon at the time, and they couldn't have known that the series would become a franchise where the ability to travel that fast would've limited the feeling of exploration because if Starfleet ships could've gone at velocities that high they would have gotten a rough idea at least of the major players and features of every quadrant and they probably would have been able to very thoroughly explore the entirety of the alpha quadrant, as well as the Beta quadrant, with the exception of areas of space controlled by hostile forces.

Anyway, I'm rambling but I'm curious if there is an in-universe explanation to reconcile this canonical inconsistency. Besides this episode, there are other examples in TOS, especially the early episodes, but this is the only break from canon in TOS that really sticks out like a sore thumb. I have no problem with stuff that isn't totally canonically consistent but I'm wondering if any clever Trekkies were able to explain this away in some book or comic.",startrek,stonerjunkyandfreak,False,/r/startrek/comments/j2svxr/do_you_consider_early_tos_episode_like_where_no/

11,Just caught the DS9 episode 'Paradise' for the first time. Alixus is probably one of the series' most infuriating villains.,1601482854,"On my first DS9 watchthrough a few years back, I used a binge-watch guide to skip some of the lower-rated episodes in Seasons 1 and 2. As such, occasionally I'll catch an episode on TV that I've never seen before. This morning, I saw 'Paradise' for the first time- Sisko and O'Brien are stranded on a planet with a community of anti-technology, anti-science human castaways, 'stranded' there for the past decade after their ship became stuck in orbit. They torture and imprison those who break their strict set of rules, and try and force Miles and Ben to stay and join them against their will. 

Their leader, Alixus, is later revealed to have stranded the whole group there on purpose, lying to the community for years about a 'naturally occurring' electric field that disabled all technology in the area; she was actually the one who used technology to generate the field. There are some very clear anti-vaxxer parallels as well- medical technology that could quickly and easily save members of the community from dying of preventable diseases is shunned in favor of herbal remedies. 

But the worst part is, at the end of the episode when Alixus' deception is revealed, and the castaways have a chance to return to civilization, they're all so brainwashed by her ideology that they *decline*, parroting her claims that 'they've found something special here'. Given the current anti-intellectual trends in our society, I found the whole episode especially infuriating, and in my opinion, Alixus in particular is one of the most contemptible villains in the series, even above Kai Winn. 

The end of Season 7 aside, when Winn does morally questionable things, she usually still has the best interests of the Bajoran people at heart, even if she views the issues from a more conservative lens. But Alixus has no such justification- her motives are almost entirely selfish, as she spends a decade forcibly imposing her Luddite beliefs on a group of unknowing converts, standing by as several suffer and die in the process. Punishment was used to stamp out resistance, until finally everyone had been fooled into believing that she was a savior for showing them a new way of life.

After Ben and Miles take her into custody, I hope Starfleet put Alixus away for the rest of her life, but even that can't begin to make up for the 10 years of indoctrination she inflicted on a group of innocent people.

Over the last year or two I have been watching lots of Trek during slow times in TV and I saved Deep Space 9 for last . I’m just finished season 3 episode 6 and I already think this is the best Trek . The characters are rich and truly develop and grow . This show is awesome to binge watch as I work from home as it holds continuity and knows how to Also have one off episodes . I rewatched Voyager this summer and enjoyed it but damn this is so much better. I just feel like this is sci-fi for adults with mature material and situations. 
Right now my ranking : 
1 . DS9
2. TNG
3. TOS 
4. VOY 
5. Disco
6. ENT 
7. Lower Decks 
8. TAS 

I don’t hate any of the shows I just love them all differently. The fact that DS9 can Over top TNG is incredible because TNG is what got me hooked on Trek to begin with . I heard amazing things about DS9 for years and I’m so happy that it lives up to the hype . The whole crew is awesome. So far the only one that hasn’t had a meaningful episode yet is the Doctor. I like him but I feel like he hasn’t been given enough backstory . I hope this changes before the show ends . The fact that I watched Voyager before Deep Space 9 makes things so odd .

Solid direction, good acting, a good plot that nods to the rest of the Trek universe, and some great SFX.

But whenever I read reviews of Insurrection, or hear fan comments on it, the primary complaint is that it was ""just like the TV show,"" a comment which confuses me, especially as it is considered a negative.  It leads to this odd dynamic:

FAN: TNG was some of the best sci-fi television of the last few decades.


ALSO FAN: This TNG movie was just like the show, therefore it isn't good.

I get that the pace of Insurrection can wander at times, but not nearly as bad as I or III (or Generations).

I just find it interesting, as, looking back through critiques of the TOS films, I rarely, if ever, see critics or fans say the film is ""just like"" the show (in fact, for TMP, it was criticized for only having a passing resemblance to TOS).

What does ""it is just like the show"" mean, and why is it a negative?  And is it because TNG was still fresh in people's minds as a TV show?

56,There's something I prefer about TOS Klingons to TNG/DS9 Klingons,1601412929,"And that's that they're more eloquent and restrained, and I'm including most of the Klingons in the TOS movies. Of course there's lots to love about TNG/DS9 Klingons and it was great (and perhaps necessary) that they fleshed out Klingon culture a bit more, giving them a bit more depth.

However, I feel that they went overboard with the whole ""honour"" thing. Sometimes it got so eye rollingly repetitive. Another small but significant annoyance was how dumb and meat headed they made so many of the Klingons in TNG/DS9. Not to mention how extremely stubborn they could be. I don't think any civilisation could sustain itself with that level of density in the skull.

With TOS and the TOS movies, you have more well-spoken, more cunning Klingons, with a restrained level of brutality. You've got Kor, Koloth, and Kang. In TUC, you've got the softly spoken Gorkon and you've got Chang (no intro or comment needed). The majority of the Klingons in TUC (especially Gorkon's daughter) are more humanised (hence more believable) which, in my humble opinion, I find more enjoyable.

And of course, there's Kruge, the best Klingon villain of them all (again, just my opinion). It's easy to create a villain that audiences will secretly like and root for, maybe even sympathise with. But I think it's quite challenging to create a compelling villain who is an outright fucking bastard. I have always despised Kruge's guts and it's always so satisfying to watch Kirk slam the sole of his boot into his fucking face 3 times.

Of course, Kruge was the proto-TNG/DS9 Klingon, pure merciless brutality, but with the cunning pragmatism to take hostages to gain an advantage over his enemy. But he still retained the TOS quality of being quite a good speaker, as opposed to the grunting of TNG/DS9 Klingons.

74,Could D'Vana Tendi be a Syndicate Agent?,1601390294,"Been watching the episodes over a few times as they really do help cheer me up and laugh after a rotten day at work, but there is something I noticed after watching all the current episodes in a single run that has me a bit curious.

Has anyone else noticed how much Rutherford has changed since he started hanging out with Tendi? 

In the first episode we saw him loose interest in  Barnes because she didn't care about the door not opening, yet in the second episode he was willing to quit Engineering all together just to spend time with Tendi watching a quasar.

Then flash ahead a little more and you have how OOC he acted with Badgey when it malfunctioned, after she admitted the instructor 'just gave her a B' without her even completing the training.

Now in the latest episode we see that Tendi is actually a very skilled hand to hand fighter, able to take out multiple Romulan guards who are armed without using a weapon herself.

There are a few other little things here and there that stand out as well, like in the first episode her reaction to finding out/assuming Boimler works on the bridge.

By and large her character is extremely friendly and kind, but we also get hints of her having a nasty side such as in the case of the guy who was supposedly trying to ascend, and of course 'The Dog' proving she is far more than just a run of the mill doctor.

It could be nothing, just reading too much into things, but at the same time these writers have proven time and again how much they love the lore of the series and how detailed their knowledge of it is. 

Quite a few people have wondered about Tendi's pheromones' if she has to take medication or something for them, but there are enough bits and pieces they've shown where it could be that she's using them after all, specifically on Rutherford.

24,Getting my partner hooked,1601274651,"Hi all,
I'm a lifelong sci-fi series fan, and while I don't primarily count myself as a ""crazy Trekkie"", ST does occupy a special place in my heart. My partner likes good stuff too, but somehow managed to get this far in life without seeing all the same shows as I did. So for me it's a constant topic of ""ooo I wish you've seen that BSG episode I'm referencing"", or ""that reminds me of the time G'Kar said that..."" Still, life is short and there is so many amazing shows to rewatch and show her the wonder of. I should also add, she is not a binge watcher, so ""sit down and watch 15 episodes in a row"" is not a plan I should suggest. But spending a few evenings a week watching something together does create excitement, watching Expanse or His Dark Materials together each week has been great... Anyhoo, I digress.... 

She sat down next to me to watch Picard, so we've been through all the ""what is a Borg"" , ""what is a romulan"", ""who is Riker"", etc. And then when Lower Decks came on and I showed the first episode to her, she positively loved it. The fact that the show is super hilarious helped too. But of course the hundred references per minute go over her head, and I spend the after episode talk quickly summing up all the cool things to know.

After this week's amazing episode I've been given the permission to compile a list of 30 episodes to give her the shakedown of ""What's Star Trek is really about"". This got me suuuper exciting, as I can give her the examples of why I love this show, without having to commit either one of us to watching the daunting number of several hundred episodes.
And I'm hoping when DIS S3 comes back I can get her hooked into jumping straight in (given it's a bit of a soft reboot), or quickly rewatch S1 and 2 (which are luckily much shorter than old school trek seasons).

So I spent half the night composing this list, and I'd love to get your input on it.

**TOS**
Balance of Terror
Menagerie (2 eps)
City on the Edge of Forever
Mirror mirror
Trouble with Tribbles

**TNG**
Q Who
Measure of a Man
Yesterday's Enterprise
Best of Both World's (2 eps)
Darmok
Unification (2 eps)
All Good Things (2 eps)

**DS9**
Duet
Far Beyond the Stars
The Visitor
Trials and Tribbleations
Purgatory's Shadow / By Inferno's light (2 eps)
In the Pale Moonlight
Siege of AR558

**VOY**
Scorpion (2 eps)
Tinker Tailor Doctor Spy

**ENT**
United / Aenear / Babel One (3 eps)

Concerns I have:
- DS9 has 8 episodes, and I spent 2 of them on ""unusual"" ones
- Siege of Ar558 spoils Jadzia's death (by the virtue of Ezri's presence) and is a sort of small sample in the middle of the war
- so I was thinking of dropping Siege and Far Beyond the Stars to add Way of the Warrior (2 eps) instead, but Fbts is so good,it bothers me. Maybe drop the Visitor instead??
- I really love S3 and S4 of Enterprise, but they are watched great as a sequence. I picked the Aenear three partner because it has Shran, Romulans, Vulcans, action, founding the Federation, etc. But I want the Soong three parter, the Kirshara three parter, and the Klingon forehead two parter too... Very hard to pick.
- how do I not have a great O'Brien episode anywhere? He is the most important man in all of Starfleet history. Canonically.

Then, upon seeing my suffering, she gave me a 5 episode runner up list. Which caused me more pain because the episodes I wish I have added are
- Chain of Command (2 eps)
- Birthright (2 eps)
- another ENT 3 parter
- emissary (2 eps)
- year of hell (2 eps)
- I Borg
- Tapestry
- Tholian Web

32,"November 19, 1994",1601262138,"In 1994, I was thirteen and only beginning to get into Star Trek, something my dad had loved for years.  It was one of just a few common interests we could bond over.  I'd watched the VHS tapes Dad had of the first six movies, I'd watched most of TOS and TNG, and I'd started reading the novels he'd suggested.

&amp;#x200B;

November 19, 1994... I went to my first Trek movie in the theater with Dad.  It was one of the only times I can remember him wanting to go to the theater on a movie's opening weekend.  We'd gone to so many movies in my youth, but most of them were more for me than anything else.  This was one of a few that was actually for *us* to enjoy together.  I remember the thrill of watching so many of my favorite characters there on the screen, sharing a big tub of buttery popcorn with Dad.  After the movie, the ushers were handing out free posters to anyone who wanted one.  Dad snagged one of the last ones for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I hung it on my door that night.

&amp;#x200B;

A few years ago, I lost my dad to cancer.  Trek remained across those years as one of our favorite things to do together.  Earlier this year, my mom sold my childhood home.  I went in to get what I wanted from it.  I found out I couldn't remove the poster without destroying it.  The poster, the physical object of a joyous memory, is gone.  [But I took a picture of it with my phone to keep](https://imgur.com/561b4175-f1b3-45ed-a7f9-7b02a1e40fe4).  The memory of that day is strong; I don't have to have the physical object, but looking at that picture still makes me feel thirteen again.

It felt to me like they had no faith in their original creations, so had to drop some fan service to keep people hooked for season 2.

But when I saw season 2, I thought everything to do with the Enterprise and its crew was the best material.

Captain Pike was perfectly written and performed and is the most Star Trek aspect of Star Trek in the last 20 years. He actually stuck out more in contrast with the hyper emotional, pew-pew pacing of Discovery as someone who’s optimistic, open-minded, and level headed. A great example that classic Trek can be done and done well in the modern era. It was fantastic.

While we’ve not really seen much of Number 1, she comes across as a better written and more relatable female character than was it seems they were going for for Burnham.

I enjoy Spock and think he was performed well, although Leonard Nimoy and Zachary Quinto also performed fantastically, even if the writing for the latter was terrible.

The Enterprise redesign is actually my favourite version of the original ship. It’s clearly the Enterprise, but how you’d imagine it would be if they made it today.

Lastly, the TOS uniform redesign is my favourite version. It looks like an actual uniform while keeping the different department colours. It doesn’t look like a sweater with a badge sewn on like in TOS or a cheap Halloween costume like in the Kelvin movies. I think the Kelvin uniforms come off as cheap to me because of the Starfleet logo patterns, which they fix in Beyond for an infinitely better design.

If they write Pike and the crew of the Enterprise the way they did in DISCO S2, I think Strange New Worlds could be genuinely fantastic.",startrek,f0rever-n1h1l1st,False,/r/startrek/comments/j0m9yh/im_genuinely_cautiously_optimistic_for_strange/

26,More DS9 trivia!,1601145059,"But this one actually has relevance to the story!

The season 4 finale, ""Broken Link"" opens with Garak calling Odo into his store. A woman comes out dressed in a Garak original, and asks how it looks. Garak replies, ""A thing of beauty is a joy for ever."" This is the first and oft-quoted line of the widely celebrated Keats poem ""Endymion."" Garak then introduces Odo to her, Chalan Aroya, a new business owner on the promenade who is interested in Odo romantically. 

The episode continues; there is something wrong with Odo and he can't maintain a shape. He is also in a lot of pain. The DS9 crew takes him into the Gamma Quadrant and meet up with the Founders to find help for him. The Founders will help him, but he must be judged by the Great Link for his earlier violence against another changeling. Odo accepts their judgement, and is turned into a human.

Aroya appears again at the end of the episode and reminds Odo, who despite his curiosity and interest in solids is none too pleased about actually being one, that there are ""advantages to being humanoid."" bow chicka bow bow

So, okay, whatever, but why did I bring up that Keats line? I mean who cares right? Leaving aside the fact that a Cardassian talking to a Bajoran for the sake of a Changeling isn't likely to drop some Yeats, it is actually a very interesting choice by the writers who are doing it for the sake of us, the viewers.

""Endymion"" is a love poem based on a Greek myth about a human, Endymion, who falls in love with the goddess Diana (or rather the idea of the goddess, or the idea of un-earthly love in general, it can be hard to tell with Greek stories what they really mean by ""love""). It is a very long poem, and Endymion goes through many travels and trials in his search for Diana, in search of the joy that he has only so far glimpsed. He eventually finds it in a mortal woman:

""In the end when [Endymion] feels the love for the mortal maiden, he realizes she is really Diana, his immortal desire in mortal disguises. He apprehends the dangers of denying his own human nature and learns that ***he can achieve the abstract ideal only if he accepts the concrete human experience.*** This is the central idea the Keats wants to deliver through this poem.""

Odo is not particularly happy to be a solid, despite his love for Kira and his general curiosity about the solid experience. But he does put a lot of stock in abstract ideals, like his love of Justice and, in a way, his love for Kira that he thinks is impossible because of their differences. In this case, Kira is the mortal and Odo is the god that becomes humanoid, but the point still stands that Odo must accept *solid, concrete humanoidism* in order to actually be able to *realize abstract concepts* like love and be true to his concept of Justice and his acceptance of the other Changelings judgement. 

Now you'll have to excuse me; I'd love to get even more into the details on this, but I'm supposed to be writing a completely different essay about a completely different poem without including any Star Trek references whatsoever…

What. The. Fuck?! 

I know this is a nitpick but it’s really mindboggling to me, Khan wasn’t born in the 19th century, aircraft and submarine warfare were well established in his lifetime! At the worst he would be aware of the theory behind both and could apply that knowledge to space combat.

To make it more infuriating the line was unnecessary, Khan was already shown to be blinded by his need for revenge, that he was giving chase into the nebula. We’d seen time and again that he was making mistakes, letting his emotions get the better of him.

50,Star Trek Botnik Scripts,1601093682,"So  I got permission from at least a mod... and apparently the first source I used reddit hated it so much that it won't let them approve it... so this is me trying again, this is likely a small bit  insanity and curiosity for me, if its not for you then that is great!

So  Botnik is a predictive text artificial intelligence, it takes in  content in the form of text files and forms a 'key board' and from that  keyboard it is able to make predictions ranked 1 to whatever on what  comes next as a word. Botnik doesn't do very well with punctuation or  grammar, even the best artificial intelligence right now doesn't to be  very candid, so the co-writing effort in making a script is mostly  trying to help Botnik to turn babbling into something a bit more  coherent (I think). Botnik tends to tell the same story (maybe in a  different way even if its done again from a fresh start) so its not  really 'choose your own adventure' or 'mad lib'.

Now...  the first script is actually posted on the botnik website, their  publishing process doesn't make any sense to me so I have been using an  alternate source (which maybe will cause issues with this post being  approved) but this first one was not cowritten by me and is from **Star Trek - The Next Generation** [https://botnik.org/content/tng.html](https://botnik.org/content/tng.html)

Its roughly speaking about random interactions on the Enterprise D including a visit from Q.

This  next one was co-written by me and since botnik took an angry nap when I  tried to feed it ALL of the deep space nine scripts I decided to just  feed it the first season, this is the result **Deep Space Nine Season 1 -  starfleet officers don't often find mates who want to raise families on a starship** [https://www.deviantart.com/thunderswimmer/art/ST-DS9-Fanfic-Botnik-Airdate-2-856245254](https://www.deviantart.com/thunderswimmer/art/ST-DS9-Fanfic-Botnik-Airdate-2-856245254)

Its roughly about Sisko trying to find the truth about the Wormhole.

The next one again co-written by me is **Deep Space Nine - Season 2 -** **The federation consulate** [https://www.deviantart.com/thunderswimmer/art/ST-DS9-Fanfic-Botnik-The-federation-consulate-856245490](https://www.deviantart.com/thunderswimmer/art/ST-DS9-Fanfic-Botnik-The-federation-consulate-856245490)

Its  roughly about Sisko trying to save someone from the ""Federation Popular  Project"", which isn't mentioned anywhere but I really love the idea,  sort of a ""Voice of America""[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice\_of\_America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_America) or ""Cool Japan"" (a project by the government of Japan to market Japan as cool, basically) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool\_Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_Japan)

This  one is less funny and actually a pretty coherent script (at least for  botnik), I took the first few Star Trek movie scripts and this came out,  **star trek: the test three**  [https://www.deviantart.com/thunderswimmer/art/ST-TOS-Movies-Fanfic-Botnik-The-test-three-856245687](https://www.deviantart.com/thunderswimmer/art/ST-TOS-Movies-Fanfic-Botnik-The-test-three-856245687)

Its  roughly about the Enterprise is sent to investigate what has happen to  the Federation project ""Test Three"", the crew has disappeared, its a  little bit of a mystery and I was really pleasantly surprised what it  turned out to be. Its an extremely humanitarian story.     &gt;!Basically Botnik tells a story, if I am reading this right, of the  Federation reaching out to save refugees in another dimension radically  different from our own escaping Jabba.!&lt;

So there we go... thats all the Botnik scrips I am aware of.

Like  I mentioned its a strange interest and hobby of mine... to do this with  botnik. If you liked it thats great. If not... ha... I can kinda  understand why botnik and this sort of work is still in its infancy.

56,"Just finished all series, what a voyage it was!",1601082858,"I started watching the series in December 2018 and just finished Enterprise around half an hour ago. Except the last episode of The Lower Decks and animated series, now I can say I watched it all.

During the voyage, I lost a job while Kirk and Spock was exploring the final frontier. Found a new job after meeting Captain Picard. Lost an uncle and an aunt somewhere in Enterprise D, went to the other side of the world while Enterprise D kept going around in galaxy.  Turned back and as Miles O'Brian was trying to make Cardassian and Fedaration technology work together, I was dealing with a heart break. Odo went to join the link as I was entering quarantine and pondering what will happen. Captain Janeway and her crew was stranded on Delta Quadrant and I was dealing with lockdown. Voyager finale really let me down. Things got easier, we turned to a 2 weeks home 2 weeks office schedule and I met Captain Archer around that time. And tonight it ended.

Even without the Covid-19 outbreak, as if it is something which can be forgotten, this 22 months of my life was a really unforgottable period with all the losses and good memories and Star Trek was there nearly every day.

I'm trying to think of a favorite character but it's too hard to decide and not fair to others to pick one (not to you Wesley). So I can't really say a favorite character...but Miles O'Brien with Colm Meaney's great acting is hard not to mention. 

Series wise, DS9 has a special place in my heart. It was just perfect in many ways. In my country, Star Trek was never on TV a lot. I even learned existence of DS9 and Voyager around 2009. Even that time, the words ""Deep Space 9"" has such a ring that I was getting excited just by imagining the concept. 10 years lateri seeing the design of Terok Nor and watching the episodes only added to the excitement. I'm not sure if I'll ever feel that towards any fiction ever.

On all series, I found myself liking the episodes involving Klingons most. There is just something very good about a traditional, mean looking warrior race capable of space travel. I wish their other aspects were more discovered just like in the episode where Archer was on a trial had those conversations with his Klingon lawyer. I'm not going to even mention those iconic episodes like ""Inner Light"", ""On a pale moonlight"", ""Far Beyond the Stars"" and many more. They are already talked about a lot.

Since it's still very fresh, my thoughts slide to T'Pol and Trip. Was it really necessary to not let them have a happy ending? Thinking of it, who even got a happy ending in all series and movies? Maybe slightly Voyager crew..but that finale was just..nevermind. General tone of the production is very optimistic about future when compared to other sci-fi but characters all suffered in a way at the end.

This is a hugely underrated episode that isn't often talked about. A [brief synopsis](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Face_of_the_Enemy_\(episode\)) for those who don't recall the episode:

&gt;Deanna Troi slowly awakens in a dark room, and is shocked to discover when she activates the room's light above a mirror that she has been surgically altered to appear Romulan. She doesn't know why or even where she is.

Disguised as Major Rekal, her chemistry with Commander Toreth (played by Carolyn Seymour who also put on a fantastic act) is very powerful. You could feel the tension everytime the two of them butted heads -- at the dinner table about Imperial training and on the bridge in front of the crew. I LOVED her speech to the bridge crew reasserting her and the Tal'Shiar's dominance with Toreth eventually being relied of duties.

Her interchanges with sub-commander N'Vek (also well-acted by Scott MacDonald) are equally gripping. Particularly enjoyable scenes include their initial banter over the predicament at hand, her scolding of N'Vek for destroying the Antares vessel, and them collaboratively devising a way for the Romulan ship to emit a traceable signal. 

The final scene was touching where Troi expresses sadness for N'Vek's death, as Picard reminds her that it wasn't in vein helping to advance the causes of the resistance.",startrek,Comp625,False,/r/startrek/comments/izry3a/spoilers_face_of_the_enemy_is_a_hugely_underrated/

I normally don't pick apart episodes like this but this felt too big to gloss over.

The scientific implication of how Riker was split is massive and it's just shrugged off by everyone. I think it at least deserved a line in the episode where O'Brien or Geordi says that they're going to present their findings to Starfleet.

Basically, the Potemkin transporter chief ""doubled the transport carrier wave"" but it turns out they only needed one beam. One beam got through the atmosphere and beamed back a Riker. The other bounced back and rematerialized another Riker at the initial location.  


So, it seems to me there's a few implications:  
1) You can easily perfectly clone someone if they can reproduce the atmospheric conditions. (Which it seems they could do because they knew a lot about what was happening).

2) Because of that, Doubling the transporter carrier wave (or whatever) should have some MUCH tighter controls over. (Such as, making sure they don't both rematerialize!)

25,Need Help From Trekkies (And Maybe Some Whovians):,1600968721," I’m trying to make a fanfic where Uhura has a daughter who would later fall in love with the long-lost half-brother of Luke and Leia from “Star Wars” (it’s a long story). Yet, the problem is that I don’t know who the father should be. In the canon films, Uhura is still single so she’s probably divorced, widowed, is yet to find “the one” or devoted her time to her career. And since I want the fanfics to be loyal to canon, I’m not sure how Spock, Sulu or Scotty could be with her in this case. Perhaps Uhura did form a relationship with them and producing the daughter. But wouldn’t they have been any implications of that? Then there’s the matter of Sulu’s kid, Demora. If Uhura and Sula did marry, where would she come from? 

Then again, Uhura could’ve been in a relationship with either Riley or Walking Bear. Uhura could’ve had a kid with one of them and they retired from Starfleet to be a devoted stay-at-home dad. Or he could’ve died before the child was born or when she was only a little baby. 

 Other candidates would have been Adam Adamant from “Adam Adamant Lives!” (Adamant was a man from Edwardian man who was frozen in a block of ice by his girlfriend and his enemy. He is later thawed out in the 1960′s where he’s now 99-100 years old); Uhura would’ve been kidnapped and taken to the late 1960′s where she escapes into the streets of Britain. There, she would meet Adamant and his companions and slowly form a romance. Yet, with the Enterprise being strict with time-travel, would Uhura let herself be with a relationship of this kind? Would this even impact the timeline? 

Then there’s The Master from the Classic “Doctor Who”. In between the transformation of the 2nd Doctor becoming the 3rd, he could’ve been sent to help the Enterprise when The Master hypnotized half of the crewman (including Uhura) and starting a cult of sorts on a mysterious planet. All the while, The Master takes a liking to Uhura and brainwashes her into being his wife. Months later a baby was on its way. By the time the Enterprise finds her and the other victims, Uhura was 9 months in. Horrified by what The Master had done, The Doctor, Kirk and the others contemplate on what to do. In the end, Uhura’s mind is put back to normal by The Doctor, and she takes her revenge on The Master when he attempts to steal her newborn daughter. When asked by The Time Lords (who were notified by The Doctor) if she wants to keep the kid, Uhura chooses to do so and names her “Penda”. For the time, The Master is taken into custody until he escapes and gives up on taking Penda as he thinks confronting The Doctor is more important. I still don’t know if I should go with this story. A half-Whovian in a Star Trek world had a great deal of potential. Yet, would this be too dark? 

I could just have Uhura be with the 3rd Doctor but The Doctor and Uhura are both too responsible to get a relationship go too far. Besides, The Doctor would probably look at her as a child. Still, what should I do?",startrek,Rosie-Love98,False,/r/startrek/comments/iz1pee/need_help_from_trekkies_and_maybe_some_whovians/
26,"I just rewatched ""Hard time"" (DS9) and it left me in shambles",1600967507,"Season 4, Episode 19.

It's not just the trauma Miles went through, it's the way they tell the story. He's clearly suffering, the moment when he almost attacks Molly hits hard. Because you know and love Miles, he's just a regular guy, who loves his job, his family and his best friend. Seeing him shattered and confused made me sad. But the best part of the episode is how they resolve it. Miles in the cargo bay, Bashir coming in at the last moment. Then they talk, and oh boy, does the murder scene hurt. Before the episode, Miles and Julian had a nice bromance going, with ups and downs, but mostly it was a cheerful story. ""Hard time"" shows that they're more than best buddies, they're friends for life. Julian loves Miles more than anybody else. When O'Brien returns to his family, you can see how much it means to him to be back home. He might have gone through hell, but now he's ready to face his demons. And he has realized that he's not alone. Colm Meaney also did an outstanding job in this episode. 

To me, ""Hard time"" is the epitome of Star Trek. It's about being human. It's about accepting your shortcomings while trying to do impossible things. And finally, it's about kindness. Ee'char may have only died in O'Brien's mind, but that doesn't matter.

28,Picard believes women,1600961877,"Watching TNG for the first time since I was a kid and my love for Picard has crystallized from seeing him believe and act on what Guinan told him in ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" and what Beverly told him in ""Remember Me."" (And also how he fought for Data's rights as a person and a father, but that's another post.)

Guinan didn't have any proof -- or even specifics -- just strong intuition that something was off. The expected reaction would be to brush her aside until some disaster pushed Picard into listening to her. Nope. He trusted Guinan and took her seriously when most people in his position would've been like, ""Come back when you have evidence.""

Same with Beverly. Even when I as an audience member thought, damn doctor has lost her mind, Picard believed her until far into the episode (by which time the audience is back on Beverly's side). 

And of course there is Troi's constant insight and advice (eye-rollingly obvious as it may be), which Picard values.

I love the portrayal of this kind of belief and respect of women, demonstrated time and time again by a powerful man. And all this back in the late 80s/early 90s. TNG showing yet again how relevant it still is. 

Ironic perhaps given the behind-the-scenes realities of the producers, etc. 

Nonetheless, it is a beautiful and refreshing thing to see these relationships that are so deeply rooted in mutual respect that the default reaction is to trust, not doubt, the word of women.

___

**Episode 8 - ""Veritas""**

* In a general sense, this episode borrows plot points from the series' namesake, TNG's ""Lower Decks,"" in which a group of ensigns contribute to the senior officers' plans but don't fully understand what's actually going on.
* Boimler laments missing pottery class. There was a sculpting class seen on the *Enterprise-D.*
* The ""trial"" copies several elements from the Klingon courtroom in *The Undiscovered Country* and ""Judgment:""
   * The defendants are raised into the chamber on a round platform, with a spotlight shining on them
   * The ""judge"" sits on a high perch in the shadows with onlookers watching from balconies
   * The ""prosecutor"" makes theatrical arguments and wears an eyepatch
* Clar is voiced by Kurtwood Smith, whose previous Trek credits include Annorax and Federation President Fu Manchu.
* Boimler's nomination for ""all-time biggest badass"" is Roga Danar, the fugitive supersoldier from ""The Hunted.""
* Mariner counters with Khan Noonien Singh, the plastic-chested space seed from *Into Darkness.*
* Earth is described as a place where all you do is ""hang out at vineyards and soul food restaurants."" The Picard family ran a vineyard in France; the Sisko family ran a Creole restaurant in New Orleans.
* The Neutral Zone is a buffer between the Romulan Empire and the Federation, and entering it is typically frowned upon. Freeman's map is a typical representation of the zone, with the Federation on the ""west"" and the Romulans on the ""east"" (in the Beta Quadrant). The Neutral Zone is usually well understood and it's not known why they would need to procure a map of it from a third party.
* ""Crazy Ivan"" is a naval maneuver not previously mentioned in the franchise, though it was highlighted in *The Hunt for Red October* (and Firefly).
* The EPS capacitors are part of the Electro Plasma System which forms a very large chunk of Treknobabble.
* Shaxs warns Rutherford again Denobulan flesh-eating bacteria. Denobulans are the polygamous puffer-fish folks most famously represented by Dr. Phlox. This is their first reference outside of ENT.
* Shaxs calls the unconscious Vulcans ""Spock"" and ""Spock."" Spock was the science officer aboard the *Enterprise* in the Kelvin films; Spock was Michael Burnham's foster brother in DIS.
* The shuttle the team uses to get to the museum is the same type seen in *The Motion Picture.*
* Vessels seen in the museum include:
   * a Type VI Starfleet shuttlecraft
   * a Ferengi shuttle, first seen in ""The Price""
   * a Jem'Hadar warship
   * a Klingon D7
   * a triangular pod and a yellow worker-beeish ship I'm too tired to identify
   * a rectangular slab which might be a Trek reference but may also just be the obelisk from *2001*
   * a 23rd-century Romulan bird-of-prey, complete with an actual bird painted on the belly
   * a Vulcan scout ship like the one seen in *First Contact*
   * a Class F Starfleet shuttlecraft
   * what *might* be a Tholian web-spinner
* Rutherford must distract the guard with a fan dance, just as Uhura did in *The Final Frontier.* Well, not *exactly* like Uhura did in *The Final Frontier.*
* Billups deliriously mumbles ""Mark Twain's got a gun,"" referencing the primary antagonist of ""Time's Arrow.""
* He then tries to warn Tasha that ""the garbage bag's behind you,"" likely a nod to Tasha Yar's unfortunate encounter with Armus in ""Skin of Evil.""
* Rutherford then wakes up at a Gorn wedding. The Gorn are primarily depicted as they were in their original appearance in ""Arena,"" and the scene also includes that episode's music and the Vazquez Rocks.
* Noticed by u/nauticalfiesta in a previous episode: the conference room's walls have the same design as that of the observation lounge during the back half of TNG.
* Ransom's team is threatened by one, two, three, four D'Deridex-class Romulan warbirds, introduced in ""The Neutral Zone.""
* Romulus was first mentioned in ""Balance of Terror"" and first seen in ""The Defector."" This episode takes place approximately one year after Romulan detente was established in *Nemesis,* and about seven years before the planet is destroyed by a supernova in *Star Trek 2009.*
* The Romulan guards complain about Remans. These were the Nosferatu toughs in *Nemesis;* their homeworld Remus can be glimpsed in an earlier establishing shot.
* Q (John de Lancie) is best known as the omnipotent villain/foil/rapscallion who irritated Picard throughout TNG; he also had a rapport with Janeway, and Sisko punched him once. Here he appears in his post-atomic horror judicial robes as he did when he was introduced in ""Encounter at Farpoint,"" and subjects the senior staff to an outlandish game as he did in ""Hide and Q"" and ""Qpid."" The crew must work together to overcome his challenge, clearly demonstrating that where they go one, they go all.
* Ransom hits on a salt vampire, the chameleonesque creature from ""The Man Trap.""
* T'Ana finds herself in a predicament where the crew is apparently being replaced by impostors. This mirrors ""Remember Me"" where Dr. Crusher notices the crew slowly disappearing; the flashback's establishing shot is of a starbase like Crusher's episode was.
* Boimler asks whether Kirk knew about ""that giant Spock on Phylos,"" a callback to ""Spock 2"" from ""The Infinite Vulcan.""
* He then wonders if Crusher knew about the Scottish ghost in the lamp, referencing ""The Visitor.""
* Boimler proclaims ""Drumhead!"" as he finishes his speech and horn-drops. In the episode ""The Drumhead"" Picard and crew are subjected to a witch-hunt trial and the captain saves the day by making one of his impassioned speeches.
* Clar was rescued from the Empire in what may be a stasis pod; members of the reunification underground were smuggled out in the same way in ""Face of the Enemy.""
* Q complains that Picard is always quoting Shakespeare. ""William Shakespeare"" is a pseudonym applied to a group of 16th-century authors, including Christopher Marlowe and Francis Bacon, who wrote dozens of plays now considered to be classics.",startrek,Antithesys,False,/r/startrek/comments/iywq7n/canon_references_veritas_spoilers/

41,Just finished another rewatch of DS9.

Let’s say they’re poring though the intelligence files at Dominion HQ on Cardassia and found proof the Federation lied. At this point the war is over and they won, but it was a lie that cost millions of Romulan lives. The Federation would argue that it was in the Romulans best interest to join the alliance. How would they react?


And the observation: Laas is probably dead. Odo unknowingly infected him with the changling virus when they linked, then Laas went off to search for other changlings. We know that changing form accelerates the progression of the disease and that Laas chose to change form a lot more than Odo did.

42,"I'm new to Star Trek, watching TNG. Just finished S3E15 Yesterday's Enterprise, and it moved me.",1600939285,"I am new to Star Trek, and wanted to give it whirl. I didn't pay much attention, since I was more focused on Star Wars as a kid, but I'm familiar enough through the cultural zeitgeist to respect the name of Gene Roddenberry. Having seen a small smattering of TOS episodes, decided I'd try TNG instead. Thoroughly enjoying what I'm seeing so far, and I'm up to season 3.

For those who need a refresher, Yesterday's Enterprise is the one with the rift in time that causes the Enterprise C to enter Picard's time during its battle with the romulans to defend a klingon outpost. The resultant defeat of the outpost restarts the Klingon-Federation war in Picard's time, making the Federation more militant and on the verge of losing the war. Guinan convinces Picard that the Enterprise C must return to that doomed battle and sacrifice itself to repair the rift in time. Picard correctly realizes that fighting the battle, and sending back Yar, who should be dead anyway, will repair/alter the course of history to create a Klingon/Federation alliance. At the last moment, Picard watches his crew die around him, defending a ship 22 years out her timeline, in the hopes that it saves the Federation from a timeline and scenario that shouldnt exist. What began as a sacrifice of the Enterprise C 22 years ago becomes an unsung sacrifice of the alternate timeline Enterprise D. And only Guinan remembers, asking Laforge about Yar, a woman she never met.

Yesterday's Enterprise was just so fucking good.

57,Spock and TOS,1600912668,"My introduction into Star Trek was late last year when I started TNG after a coworker was amazed that I had never seen a single episode of Star Trek since it was right up my alley, and I loved it so much. When I finished it in the beginning of the year I moved on to TOS, which was a bit difficult for me to get into, and although I prefer the plots of TNG, by season 2 I got a real appreciation for TOS, and specifically Spock. Data was my favorite character of TNG, so naturally I figured Spock would be my favorite of TOS, but I didn't expect him to become my favorite character overall. His delivery, nonchalatness, logical drive, and sassy direct comments are the best. Data was logical like Spock, but he was always consumed with trying to understand why humans acted the way they did, whereas Spock either assumed he understood humans fully or just didn't care what they thought and continued on doing him without regard for social norms or personal perception.   


Spock was always observing and analyzing situations, circling through the phrases 'fascinating', 'curious', and 'interesting' indicating when and how something intrigued him, which would normally be missed or considered boring to most. I thought he used the phrases interchangeably, but over time I noticed that he used 'fascinating' when something happened that couldn't be explained by their known science, 'curious' when the facts of the situation were narrowing down leading to an explanation, and 'interesting' when something behaved or acted different from logical expectation. Spock's interactions with McCoy are hilarious and relatable since I as a science graduate student obsessed with data analysis and nerdy 'boring' stuff have been teased for my lack of interest and participation in most 'normal' things.  


In the episode ""The Ultimate Computer"" McCoy, annoyed with Spock's logical nature, digs at Spock for completely ignoring and and being seemingly uninterested in the fact that they are all about to die and is instead consumed with why the computer is behaving illogically. As he thinks out loud McCoy says, ""Please Spock, don't say its fascinating.""  And without missing a beat, Spock replies, ""No. But it is.. interesting.""  


Stupid McCoy, hahaha. This is one of the funniest moments in television for me, how can the writers be funny on so many levels, and its still funny 50+ years later.

Since the Q are eternal he could really jump into any existing series or helm a new one. In Lower Decks Matiner pointed out that a Q could be a perfect excuse for anything bad that happens.

80,Newbie here🖖🏾 Which show/movie introduced you to the Star Trek Universe and what are your fav?,1600884404,"
Currently watching Lower Decks after watching most of the series and what a great animation with a really impressive gag rate. Easter egg after Easter egg!

DISCO was my entry into the universe. Patiently waiting for S3 now. I loved it and it got me curious so I watched the JJ Abrahams films and I was hooked!

I then started watching them backwards moving onto ENT and I gotta say, I was so not ready for that switch from season-long story arcs to standalone episodes. After that awesome pilot which set insanely high expectations, I was so confused cos I expected the story to continue in the following episodes. Hated the format at first but slowly got used to it and now enjoy the show as it is. First seasons of ENT where disappointing and almost quit several times but these ST shows have a tendency to grow on you even with their mediocre starts... the nice thing about stand-alones is that you don’t miss much if you skip an episode. S3 and S4 were really good.. except for that last episode🤦🏾‍♂️  (I didn’t know who Riker was at the time and holodecks werent very familiar to me so I was super confused. wish they gave it a proper finish)

I noticed these older series are a bit harder to binge compared to the latest ones. I guess it should be obvious given their format. I then moved onto Voyager and loved it although I feel like some of the episodes could have been better told over 2 or more episodes. Some resolutions felt rushed. I then watched TNG and after skipping several episodes in the first two pretty boring seasons, it slowly became my fav... i think we can all agree that TNG theme is the official song for Star Trek. I then watched Picard after TNG and ... it was okay but felt like a wasted opportunity. Nothing memorable besides Easter eggs although It was a good set up for a new crew to start new things in S2 so let’s see where that goes.

... and then I moved onto DS9 😭 this is by far my Fav.  I was surprised this wasn’t more popular than it seemed to be. It has really good writing, rarely skipped episodes and has what feels like a much more realistic take on the utopia that is the Star Fleet and the Federation along with its flaws. Sisko is the best and most badass Capt in Star Fleet! VOY and DS9 seriously need DVD releases.

The older movies are pretty weak to be honest. They feel like very long episodes with a high budget. Wrath of Khan is really good though and I also enjoyed First Contact. 

Now I’ve just started TOS... and i can’t get past the very weird and disturbing first episode. Why the misogyny? And it’s got high ratings too ??? I know this show was made back when black people in the USA were only starting to be allowed to vote legally so I guess it makes sense. Question to any non-white Star Trek fans who might be reading this, is TOS worth watching?

Anyways if there’s other newbies there I’d love to hear your experiences. It’s interesting to see a lot of online debates.

I started watching DS9 in July and have already finished it. Suffice it to say that I love DS9 even more. I was unsure of it when I watched the first episode, but by the end of season 1 I was certain that this show was going to be even more enjoyable than TNG, and I was right. 

After finishing up with DS9 (did that ending break anyone else's heart?) I was excited to start with VOY. After the first episode I thought that there wasn't a good character to latch onto like in TNG or DS9. Sure, Capt. Janeway was competent, but she wasn't really interesting. As the season went on I found that the same could be said for the other characters. 

I just don't find any of them interesting or even likable. Neelix is annoying, Tom Paris lacks depth, I found Chakotay's character to be very dated, and so on. Then I did some reading and discovered that the characters don't really change significantly over the series. At that point I figured that the show might not be for me.

Nonetheless, I have to ask the people of this forum; Does the show get better? I consider myself an avid Trekkie at this point, and I'm not about to give up on this show. What do you like about it? What's your favorite aspect of the show and why?

Now, Rand was never my favorite character, to be honest her interactions with Kirk always seemed a little dry on screen despite the apparent attraction going on (I could never see it but that is how it's written). However I'm not foolish enough not to realize how big of a deal it was for girls to see a woman on a popular TV show.

What disgusts me even more, is that she was never given a concrete answer why she was being let go, she often suspected the executive made the decision so he wouldn't have to see what he had done every time he saw her.

12,Something Bothering me About Yesterday's Enterprise,1600833754,"So I've seen the episode several times and saw it again on BBC America a few days ago. Great episode, seriously. I love Tricia O'neil as an actress and the 1701-C is my favorite Enterprise, I really like the design of the Ambassador class. They should give the C a series or movie, something! 

I feel like it was a time where they still were transitioning from the wild west days of Kirk and co. to the orderly, by the book Starfleet of Picard. And not insignificantly: To my knowledge, Rachel Garrett was the first and thus far ONLY woman to command Starfleet's flagship or any ship named Enterprise. That Castillo was kinda cute, too.

But one thing has always bothered me about the episode: The Enterprise C never fired it's weapons. Why? Picard had sent repair teams to assist the C's crew with getting combat systems online. Yar was there overseeing the work and showing the crew how to make their weapons and shields more effective. We were told at one point that most of the phasers were operational, but not all at full power.

It seems quite odd that the C failed to return fire either of the times it came under attack. Garrett was an experienced captain, presumably the best of her day given what ship she was commanding. Was she simply unable to give the order to return fire before she was killed (by a piece of resin from a Japanese model, not a very dignified way to go)? If that were the case why didn't Lieutenant Castillo give the order or do it himself?

Yes, the first attack happened quickly and Garrett was dead in moments. But what about the second attack? Picard literally sacrificed his Enterprise to save the C. That battle lasted more than long enough for the Enterprise C to get a few shots off and at least damage one of the Klingon ships. 

Maybe their weapons just weren't working at all. Then why would Yar or Castillo or Picard return the Enterprise C back into the vortex unarmed? The whole point of them going back in time was to out up a fight, to make a bold statement before they were lost, to show the Klingons that Starfleet had honor and could be a reliable ally. 

It was established that the weapons were functional. Not 100% but enough to defend itself from one Klingon ship at least.

Two of the recurring villains in Star Trek TOS are the Klingons and the Romulans, stand-ins for the USSR and China respectably. However although it's safe to say that Star Trek TOS is very pro-American, I don't think it is safe to say that it is pro-capitalism simply because TNG, as well as movies 4 and 8 make it clear that the Federation does not operate on a capitalist economic model and actually operates on a *Moneyless* economic model.

27,Star Trek: First Contact theory,1600815841,"The gist of my theory: The Borg didn't travel back in time solely to assimilate the Earth of the past or destroy it--The Borg wanted to (1) give their 2063 counterparts an edge against Humanity and (2)  capture the Enterprise-E, Picard, and Data and return to the Prime timeline with them. 

We've seen time and again in Trek that the creation of parallel timelines is the usual result of altering the past. I don't think the Borg expected to destroy the Prime timeline Federation by  assimilating the Earth of the past. We got a glimpse of what that parallel universe would have looked like had the Borg succeeded.  

The main goal was to first draw the Enterprise into the battle (the Borg echoes in Picard's head at the beginning of the movie). They only sent one cube to Earth, knowing full well that it likely couldn't withstand an attack by the Sector 001 fleet plus the Ent-E. Shortly after the Ent-E arrived, the cube was destroyed. The cube then sent its primary weapon back--the time warping sphere--as a lure and hook for Picard's Enterprise.

Getting the Ent-E back to 2063 would have been the perfect way to isolate and take over the ship without the support of other Federation vessels. The Borg sent other echoes to Picard while he was down on the planet, and drew him back to the ship before shutting down communications and transporters. 

Going back to 2063 was also the perfect way to gain intel on a semi-advanced, nearly warp-capable humanity before Earth had support from Vulcan and other civilizations. 

The Queen was just an advanced drone with (1) the ability to lead the Borg crew without support from a 24-century collective and (2) seductive capabilities. The Borg wanted Picard and Data--and the Ent-E--and return with them to the 24th century to improve their capabilities in the Prime Timeline. With Data, the Queen was very nearly successful. She was going to seduce Data, and break Picard.

Before I only saw reboot movies and some episodes of DS9 but that was long time ago. I decided to watch it from the beginning because that's just how I like to get into new things, I don't want to miss anything.

I have finished TOS, watched some episodes of TAS and first 4 original movies. Then I jumped to the beginning of TNG (I know that it is recommended to watch first 6 movies before TNG, but I'm watching by production order).

To be honest I'm not sure what to think about it. Generally, I enjoy it very much. But on the other hand, I'm very often just bored. The quality of stories is very very uneven. I really liked some TOS episodes like Balance of Terror for example, but most of it wasn't that great. Now, after Encounter at the Farpoint, I saw entirely new quality and I know that I'm going to continue watching it. The episode was amazing and seeing McKoy again was great for me because it was probably my favorite character from TOS.

So to wrap it up, I know that I'm going to continue watching it anyway, but I'm curious if it will satisfy my expectations. I'm hoping for something, I don't know how to name it, but ""big"". I didn't like episodes with some random villages and generic storylines. I want to know this world better, I want some longer story arcs, character development, some big scale events and the status quo to change sometimes.

Hello everyone¡ I´m working on a fan edit of Star Trek: Nemesis. It is well known that the deleted scenes were cut mostly to give the film a more commericial appeal and more action, but they could have made a much better movie. My edit cuts most of the redundant and worst scenes while trying to recover the missing scenes, at least the best ones that could fit properly in the movie.

[https://i.imgur.com/vvUDCHf.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/vvUDCHf.jpg)

Other people have tried to make a fan edit of the last of TNG movies, but the greatest problem is the really low quality of the avaliable footage of the deleted scenes. They suffer from very low resolution, interlacing, bad edge enhacement and wrong aspect ratio. In addition, some of them have green screens that were purposed to be replaced with VFX in post-production.

**Here is a list of all the deleted scenes avaliable:**

I have made a lot of progress towards creating this ""Actor´s Cut"" of Star Trek: Némesis. But the costs are important, i have already spent more than 600$ and hundreds of hours in this project and i won´t be able to pay the costs of the following needed steps:

**-Removal of the credit letters in 3 of the improved deleted scenes:** This needs to be made frame by frame, using painting and masking methods to cover the credits and replacing them with extended textures from surrounding parts in each frame, as the camera is moving, especially in two of that scenes

.-**Improvement on the stereo track of the used deleted scenes:** The audio track that we find in the deleted scenes is a mediocre stereo track that needs to be fixed by makingthe voices smoother and more clear, plus removing the weird background sound.

**-Music for the deleted scenes:** Ofc, the deleted scenes need their own music. There´s a need to chose the proper music for each scene.

I have worked with an VFX and Video Fixing specialist that helped me to fix the video in most of the deleted scenes. I will put a ""before and after"" video soon so you can check it.

Hope you enjoyed the read and don´t be shy to comment or help with any proposals and opinions.

**-Removal of the credit letters in 3 of the improved deleted scenes:** This needs to be made frame by frame, using painting and masking methods to cover the credits and replacing them with extended textures from surrounding parts in each frame, as the camera is moving, especially in two of that scenes.  
\-**Improvement on the stereo track of the used deleted scenes:** The audio track that we find in the deleted scenes is a mediocre stereo track that needs to be fixed by makingthe voices smoother and more clear, plus removing the weird background sound.  
**-Music for the deleted scenes:** Ofc, the deleted scenes need their own music. There´s a need to chose the proper music for each scene.  


I have worked with an VFX and Video Fixing specialist that helped me to fix the video in most of the deleted scenes. I will put a ""before and after"" video soon so you can check it. 

Hope you enjoyed the read and don´t be shy to comment or help with any proposals and opinions.

54,Lower Decks is great but the character of Mariner is ruining it.,1600734604,"I’m genuinely enjoying Lower Decks. I don’t care that for the most part I don’t find it rolling on the floor funny, I just enjoy the lighthearted romp through the TNG world which so far avoids the often pretentious and uningratiating Trek of today. 

However what is going on with Mariner? It’s clear her character is supposed to be cool, and laid back, funny and low key genius, but she comes off as annoying, patronising, condescending and downright dangerous. 

I keep hoping that she will be taught some lesson, or she will make a mistake, or have some kind of flaw beyond being too damn clever and not caring. Occasionally she portrayed as this, but usually it’s just a ruse to get out of taking responsibility or proving she’s better in some way than an uptight typical ‘starfleet’ character. 

Some may feel people have a problem with her‘strong character’. Quite the contrary. I think her characterisation is in fact weak and contradictory. If she hates starfleet so much why is she there? Does she secretly believe in starfleet’s values but is on a massive rebellious streak from her starfleet parents? Or is starfleet the only life she’s known and she’s deep down too scared to break away? 

All good characters have flaws, it’s how we emphasise with them. Picard is an awesome captain, but lacks a family, or ability to operate in the informal world. Ezri Dax was an old confident person in a young and insecure mind. Data couldn’t crack a joke. Tilly’s social awkwardness, Riker’s daddy issues. Mariner’s cockiness, laziness and arrogance appeared (perhaps unintentionally) as flaws to begin with, but now as the series progresses it seems we should be rooting for the character despite this? 

Seen as she’s in the same time as TNG, I wander just how she would have been treated on the Enterprise, and contrast with the characterisation of similar characters portrayed then. Riker would have certainly doled put some home truths, like he did Ro Laren and Shelby, but Picard would have got to the heart of it. Troi of course there to tidy up the psychological results of the epiphany. 

I sincerely hope she does get some lesson in humility, and in overcoming her flaws becomes a more well rounded, strong character because of learning from mistakes, not simply because we are told she is ‘strong’. 

Because she’s ruining an otherwise excellent show, and is fast becoming Star Trek’s worst protagonist role model.",startrek,opinionated-dick,False,/r/startrek/comments/ixcynp/lower_decks_is_great_but_the_character_of_mariner/

Will we ever get really interesting future military dram like ""The Wounded"", or thoughtful exercises like ""Measure of a Man"" from Star Trek again? I fear that era is over.

The Borg appear menacing to almost all other groups, so much so that unlikely alliances will form just to oppose the Borg, they themselves do not regard themselves as hostile.  

The Borg are connected by a hive-mind network of shared real-time communication via mobile networking — high-speed wireless broadband and a dominant social network. This connectivity has also been used to exploit and overcome the Borg in several notable battles.

In Star Trek, the Borg represent a large, aggressive and imperial adversary.  US audiences were unlikely to catch on that this adversary was themselves. Instead, they perhaps likened the Borg to other perceived adversaries like Russia or China, which did not generally absorb other cultures and assimilate their people into a new synthetic culture.

The best way to describe him is that Tim Curry ‘Spaaace!’ clip from Red Alert 3, but somewhat believable as an actual human being.


He is a complete, self-confessed, egomaniac. Normally in Star Trek, characters with egos the size of Ceti Alpha V are villains, or at least somewhat antagonistic, think Gul Dukat, or Gowron. Seletekbreaks this mold by not only being a fellow with the best intentions, but soles the central issue of the episode with a real 200 IQ move.


Problem: His wife is obviously unhappy in their marriage, causing the psycho-projections. These psychoprojections will kill her if she keeps doing it. They can’t just divorce (like he has been nine times before), because members of his wife’s race mate for life.


Solution: Careen yourself into a dead star, reigniting it in the process. With Seyetek dead, his wife is free to move, and find true happiness with someone else.

86,Which episode should I recommend to my friend?,1600702108,"Convinced her to start watching Star Trek on the basis of its values, not space or some other genre, so would prefer episodes without too much sciency stuff or galactic politics.

Started with 'In the pale moonlight'. She liked it but felt it was too complicated, so would like episodes that don't require much of a backstory.

And TOS won't be liked that much, so unless there is some episode that aged well / unmissable, the other shows would be preferred.",startrek,DarthMaw23,False,/r/startrek/comments/ix2leu/which_episode_should_i_recommend_to_my_friend/
87,"Does anyone else feel like modern Star Trek isn't ""goofy"" enough?",1600701766,"I don't know maybe it's just me being goonish but I feel like a lot of the older series charm was that most of the episode's where just wacky adventures with funny little alien guys running around. (Obviously there was a lot more than that going on but I think it's a fair summary). And there was more serious toned episodes that where to be honest usually the best, but what made them good is that they where rare. It seem's like in Discovery and the other new stuff it's always extremely serious, death, betrayal and trauma (bar the scene in Picard when he plays dress up). It's pretty much just like a goth version of the older series. I just wanna see an  episode that has nothing to do with politics or dark insight of the human psyche.

90,DS9 re-watch,1600700420,"So it’s been a while since I watched DS9, and this is my first rewatch of the show. It’s so frickin good! But the characters are what stand out to me. During my original watch Odo was my absolute favourite character, and that was it. But after taking another look, he is still in the top spot but he now joins it with Bashir. Those two are brilliant. But the thing is, they may be my favourite characters, but there’s absolutely no character I hate. Well, except maybe Jake. I didn’t like the Ferengis at first but Quark is just such a likeable character as he develops. Nog and Rom grew on me too, though I will say the way Ferengi men treat Ferengi women still bothers me. As for the rest of the characters, they’re all amazing. Garak, Dax, Sisko, Dukat. They’re all awesome! I forgot how good this show was.

91,How long is the first season of Voyager in the show?,1600699533,"I've just started on season 2 of Voyager (so no spoilers pls!) and there's an episode where one of the crewmembers reveals at the end that's she's discovered she's pregnant. She says that it's the only thing she's got left to remember her husband by, since he's back in the Alpha Quadrant.

But given that season 1 of Voyager was broadcast over 6 months, i thought that was how long it took place over. But obviously if that was the case she would be in her 3rd trimester by now. So either she's scoodilypoopin with someone else and is a bit of an idiot for genuinely thinking it's her husbands child, or the whole of season 1 take place over 1 month at most.

Or maybe the writers just weren't really thinking. What do you think it is?",startrek,Tychus_Balrog,False,/r/startrek/comments/ix1s94/how_long_is_the_first_season_of_voyager_in_the/

The interviewer, or should I say interrogator, is never completely recognizable. Yet I feel like we are meant to know him (the scenes were shot as if they were creating a little mystery around him). Either a cameo or a glimpse of things to come...

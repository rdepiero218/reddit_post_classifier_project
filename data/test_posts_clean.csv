12,How I would remake fallout 1,1601663166,"I've been thinking about this for awhile. What I would do is break the game up into several world spaces. For fallout1 the starting world space would contain Vault 13, 14, Shady Sands, raiders camp and radscorpion cave. The second world space would have Junk Town on the north end and the Hub(canonised as barstow California) in the south. The third world space would be the largest, the ruins of Los Angeles. Necropolis(Bakersfield), the botherhood bunker and the glow would be their own areas the size of point lookout. To the fill the space in between fallout 1s maps I would include the ruins of real world towns, abandoned 19th century mines, highways and interstates with rusting road signs like in new vegas. DLC areas would be Dayglow (San Diego) and Santa Catalina island. When the player travels between world spaces a recreation of the classis world map comes up. This could allow for random encounters.

14,Making the fallout map in AOC2,1601661732," If I can when I'm done I'll try make this downloadable 

Thoughts on my opinion of a possible senario for new England. I plan to add more to the senario in the future such as what happened to the brotherhood after FO4 (currently in imagining them retreating south the New York and the surrounding area were they spliter into different groups and fight for the areas resources and for what they think the future of the brotherhood should be) or the enclave after FO3 (possibly hold out in Chicago)

Minutemen backstory 
I went with the minute man ending and imagined what would happen a few possible years down to line. I imagine the minute men expanding similar to how the NCR did providing safety for settlements that chose to join them. Until in the west their borders hit the Nuka world raiders and gunners and in the north they hit tribes trappers. I imagine the minute men starting in conflict with the raiders and trappers but not the gunners since the gunners have a small border and I believe the gunners wouldnt strike at a strong opponent like a victories minutemen. I will in the future be making it so the minuteman have a few settlements that they are in an alliance with such as diamond city or for harbour. 

Minutemen game
The player would begin their playthrough as the minutemen in a two front war against the raiders and trappers with a relatively good economy (compared to other factions) but a smaller army only capable of defending their current territory 

Difficulty Rating : easy 

Nuka world raiders backstory 
I imagine the Nuka world raiders becoming a sort of slave empire similar to the caesar's legion although being far less organized and still split into 3 gangs hence why I will I the future make them 3 separate entitys in an alliance together (I'm still deciding borders for the factions over for now). They have pushed north until hitting the gunners who they attacked and were repelled by so they now turn their sights on the minutemen after hearing of their trouble with the northern trappers and over extension of their forces. They Began raiding into minutemen territory and capturing settlements and beginning their invasion of the commonwealth for the first time (since the sole survivor simply doesnt come across this faction in this world) with a raider force so large it will need to attack the minutemen now before they turn on each other.

Nuka world raiders gameplay 

As the Raiders you start far weaker than the minutemen with lower economy population technology level and size but having two advantages being a large military compared to your size and the majority of the minuteman forces being in the north fighting trappers at the onset of the game. (In the future this will be split into the three gangs giving you one more disadvantage because of the disorganization)  

Difficulty Rating: medium

Trappers backstory 

Northern tribes of raider like people known as trappers have United and wish to retake land they lost to the minutemen and their allies so that they can freely launch raids against the people of far harbour and other northern settlements. They have the greatest force ever assembled by their people and have been waging war with the minutemen for months and while militarily they match the minutemen they economically cannot and if their current army is defeated they will not be able to rebuild and will be once again pushed further north

Trappers gameplay

I truth dont pick them. You start with the minutemen more than a match for you on the border and currently at war with them. You are weaker in every way than them with your only advantage being your allies in the nuka world raider who are also stronger than you and could very well simply attack you after you finish fighting the minutemen. I dont plan to make them stronger as they are meant to be the last blow of a dieing way of life that is trying to reclaim its former glory

Difficulty rating : very difficult 

The gunners 

The gunners are the only faction not currently at war with the minutemen although they are not friendly with the minutemen after the attack from the nuka world raiders and them being expelled from the commonwealth after a war with the minutemen they are still trying to recover. Their current interests are in rebuilding and fortifying the land that they have since they still have enough resources to do so and then possible expansion west or southward away from the commonwealth until they rebuild their former strength 

Gameplay 

The gunners currently dont have a whole lot to do as I am still deciding what I think will be their new southern and western neighbours (possibly the brotherhood or enclave) right now you have a decent economy and decent military and a tech level equal to the minutemen. You certainly cannot beat the minutemen unless you immediately get involved in the raider minuteman war but you are will be able to move in other directions. My plan for the gunners is for them to start in a bad spot but unlike the trappers not be pinned to the wall and have time to gather strength before you have to fight a big power.

15,Fallout 4: Flair Gun Not Doing Anything,1601661580,"Hey so I decided to ignore the minute men questline as I always do. I did the first few missions up to the point where I cleared out the CoreVega assembly plant for Tenpennies Bluff. I’m playing on survival mode and started diving into the settlement building and upkeep. I haven’t done many official quests at all just tasks. I started clearing out some locations and decided I wanted to try the flare gun. I shot it in the air around Medford Hospital, the location that super mutants and have it near the Taffington Boathouse. I was excited I had just respecked my character Completely using up every quick slot keybind with weapons Proficient in different situations and at different ranges including my meds and grenades. One of which was the flare gun. When I shot it up nothing happened. I didn’t get any sort of message nobody came no flares were shot up. Nothing it was sort of anti-climactic as I was standing outside of the super mutant infested Hospital with an arsenal and Kait equipped with grenades and ammo. So I took my psycho MedX squirrel soup and jumped in. Later I tested it some more and the flare gun just doesn’t work at all for me. Now I was wondering if there was a mission you have to complete before the flare gun is able to be used. I want to know right here I said no to Preston when he asked me to be the general. I didn’t want to go down that route I just wanted to leave those settlers at sanctuary Hills.

18,Fallout: The Musical,1601658182,"I have been thinking about musicals a lot lately, having watched ""Little Shop of Horrors"", ""Beetlejuice"", and listened to the soundtrack to ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"", and wondered if Fallout would work as a Musical. A dramatic, rather than silly one. 

Vault-Tec would obviously have an ensemble song near the beginning, entitled ""Your new life underground"", but I'm having trouble thinking about what the rest of it would be about. And whenever I have an idea I would like to share with a passionate community, I take it to reddit. 

I think the main issue of this idea is the various storylines and completely different characters - there are 6 total (if you don't include Fallout Tactics : BOS). Fallout 1, 2, 3, New Vegas, 4, and 76. 

I haven't played 1, 2, or 76, but I know 3, New Vegas, and 4. 

But the main point of Fallout is in its choices- any one playthrough is as valid as another, so you cannot nail down a single fallout story as the ""right"" one- you can play as a goody 2 shoes, or a complete scoundrel. 

But if we could decide on one, this could happen!

30,Anyone else think it would be great if you could scrap legendary items and get the legendary enchantment?,1601649932,"As I was playing through fallout 4 for the Nth time, I was looking through my chest of legendary items and I thought that it would be great if you could scrap the item, and get it's legendary effect.

For example, say you found an assassin's pipe wrench. you could scrap the pipe wrench and get the ""Assassin's"" legendary effect and be able to put it onto any weapon or set of armor you had, with the right ranks in gun nut, or armorer respectively.

This would not only allow for you to optimize the build you want to have in the game, but it also allows you to transfer your favorite type of legendary effects to your favorite weapons and armor. Now, you no longer have to throw that never ending pipe bolt action pistol in a steamer trunk and never touch it again, and instead transfer it over to your minigun or double barrel shotgun.

While one good legendary weapon can make you OP, there is still that randomness factor of what type of legendary item the NPC will drop. But I would say on the whole, being able to customize the the legendary enchantments would make both 76 and 4 a LOT more fun and make getting the legendary weapons and such more exciting then ""Oh, hooray, another legendary item I'm not gonna use.""

I know technically Skyrim does this with it's enchantments and with a lot more depth. But just the idea of being able to mix and match the effects that go well with the build would add a lot more depth to this already shallow experience. Not to mention maybe add some kind of ROLE in this ROLEPLAYING game.

I'm sure there's a mod for this somewhere on the nexus, but I'm too lazy right now to take a look, and I'm also not really talking about mods, but rather the base game itself. Anyways, to make a long ramble short, I feel like that it would have been a great idea, being able to modify the legendary effects in the base game rather then having to resort to mods.

34,Some good ideas for a new Fallout,1601648195,"Now being a possibility that a new Fallout title comes out sooner (thanks to Obsidian and Bethesda going to be able to work together), I started to think that it could be a new experience, since as much as I would like a Fallout NV 2, this one I don't know if It would be the best option and it does not follow the pattern in which Bethesda publishes Fallout games. 

Fallout 5: in Chicago! 
We already know from the lore that there is an outpost of the Enclave in Chicago, and it would be interesting to have the Enclave as the enemy again, but this time give the option of being able to join. Also, Chicago is quite separated from other cities that previous Fallouts have taken place in, and this will have a greater chance of bringing in some new enemies, or at least not bringing in super mutants again. Also there are many prestigious universities at Chicago, especially when talking about economics, and that could extend to many fun ideas like maybe the main factions being representations of the rebirth of capitalism and comunism, aside from the third possible Enclave Faction

There could be a juicy mix between Obsidian writing and Fallout 4 gameplay, because as much as they complain that it was more like a shooter, Fallout 4 survival was just great.

This got me quite fired up and I already have entire planning pages that are too long to put in reddit, besides that they are just dreams :(, but if you are interested in the idea I am very interested knowing your ideas or what you would expect from a new Fallout.

I base myself on the idea that these games are based on the place and the lore, the map design, the history, the characters and factions, the mechanics, the loyalty to the franchise and originality.

Being aware of the potential impending doom from their war with the US. These vaults however had no crazy social experiments. Their primary goal was simply survive until the surface is more or less eligible for living, then rebuild.

One of the most ideal story idea was the following:

Vaults opened, but most of the vaults revolted against the old communist regime, and created their own system. Upon rebuilding the surface they became separated factions.

The questions:

Could this idea be made into a real Fallout game? Despite not playing in US.

I have piper I press triangle to make her equip a rifle but after the fight she changes it or if there is no fight she goes back to her pistol. I don’t think I’ve actually seen her use the rifle. Rifle still has ammo do I have to make her equip it every time before each fight. When it comes to armor she keeps her armor on but for her gun she always goes back to her personal gun. Even if all the other guns I give her have a bunch of ammo. 
2. Settlement how do I get more people is it just beds or a combination of all. Can people only be assigned to one task. If I plant 5 corn plants and assign one person will he take care of all 5 corn plants or just one. I wish when you select the corn plant it tells you who’s assigned to it or would let you assign straight from the plant instead of having to hunt them down. Having trouble expanding because of these reasons and confusions. Should I just focus on one settlement and leave the others in the dust I feel like handling 5 or 10 however many they are is impossible. 
3.power armor I only have one skeleton so I can only have one armor ? Probably should just wait till brotherhood of steel quest line to start going into power armor ? 
4. I heard you can add songs from older fallout games but when I talk to diamond city radio host he doesn’t say anything just acts shy. 
5. If I sell bobble heads or magazines that give me the perk and stat boosts do I still keep the boosts or do I lose the boosts. 
6. Also is it like Skyrim where enemies scale so no matter how high I go in levels mole rats and ghouls will go with me so I can never really just one shot them all.",Fallout,nano_shrimp,False,/r/Fallout/comments/j3c5be/some_fall_out_4_questions_that_i_feel_the_game/,1

But what if we had a game involving the Legion in an area that isn't civilized at all?

West Texas would be a good location for this idea, since it borders the Legion. If West Texas were completely overrun by raiders and other gangs, the Legion would be a pretty good choice when considering your options for the future of the area. Put some barely surviving towns in the area, and since the Legion is very good at keeping order, it would make sense for the townspeople to be excited for legionaries to march into their town.

Okay it's just that I have low happiness on settlements (a lot of settlements have all their needs met and more and their happiness is always under ~80) and I'm contemplating just wiping all settlements because it feels like babysitting. I'd like some fair warning if I should do that if it were to effect anything. 

But what I mean as to how do they work is that I have a fair amount of settlements that are extremely low on happiness (~10 or below) yet literally no one occupies those settlements. They're barren and untouched. 

If I recall, I've heard that if happiness gets too low, you can lose permanent control over the entire settlement (please tell me this is wrong lol) 

So how can this be? I'm so confused. Also, some settlements can have everything yet happiness will randomly plummet?? Also, I can go to ""Workshops"" under ""Data"" and it will tell me that, Sanctuary for example, has 10 people, low resources and 40 happiness but when I go there there's 20 people, high resources and 80 happiness???

180,I am going to attempt to count all of the lights in Diamond City(No Mods),1601492843,"So one day(today) I was bored out of mind in Diamond City shopping for scrap when after I took a good look around Diamond City and I realized that there are ALOT of lights in Diamond City so after counting how many this is the result:

P.S I am not counting neon lights so sorry Nick.

P.P.S here are the types of lights I found in Diamond City:

Bulb lights,

Lantern lights,

Searchlights,

Fluorescent lights,

and fire lanterns.

The Stadium lights:When I refer to stadium lights I mean the big spotlights on the stadium walls that point down into the city,anyway there are 7 spotlights,2 do not work,so that makes 5 spotlights to count.The first one has 48 working bulbs,the second on has 34 working bulbs,the third one has 37 working bulbs,the fourth one has all 75 bulbs in working order,and the fifth one also as 34 working bulbs.Since 48+34+37+75+34 equals 228,we can conclude that there are 228 bulbs in working order on the stadium.

The Upper-Stands:This one is pretty easy since the upper-stands are small and as so doesn't need so many lights so after counting I can conclude that there are 36 lantern lights,3 fluorescent lights,and only one searchlight.Adding these up we get exactly 40 lights.

Now before I count the lights in Diamond City proper I need to say that in order for me to make counting easier i'm going to divide the DC proper into sections so please bear with me.Now let's continue!

Home,Third,First,and Second street:These are the main streets of DC where everyone lives,the combined total of the number of lights here is 38.There were 19 lantern lights,14 bulb lights,and 5 fluorescent lights.

Sheng Kawolski's Water shop/DCR(Diamond City Radio):There are 25 total lights in this area,which were 2 searchlights,20 bulb lights under the DCR studio(I know weird place),2 standslights,and 1 fire lantern.

The Farm/the stage:If your confused about what area I'm talking about,I'm talking about the area that place where McDonough made his speech and the small farm right across to it,anyway after counting there are 6 standlights,10 lantern lights and 2 fluorescent lights,adding to a total of 18 lights.

The Market:I just want to say this took me quite a while because there are so many lights here but I will do my best,anyway after counting the total is 243 lights with 27 of them being lantern lights,8 of them being searchlights,another 8 being fluorescent lights,and 200 of them being bulb lights.

So with the numbers we have we can add 228+200+40+38+25+18=549.There you have it folks,an astounding 549 lights!

Kill Me.

TL;DR:There are 549 lights in Diamond City and I now wanna die.",Fallout,Mrminutemansupreme,False,/r/Fallout/comments/j2sih0/i_am_going_to_attempt_to_count_all_of_the_lights/,1

Bethesda did a great job with modernisation of the Fallout series:

- Companions
- Crafting System
- Combat System
- Graphical Overhaul
- Settlement System

And I really don't have to tell anyone how great Bethesda is at World Building.

Obsidian does not run away from OG Fallout Lore, we saw that with New Vegas. There were so many references to the old games and personally I learned much more about the Fallout World than I did with Fallout 4.

Obsidian WILL deliver with:

- Lore
- Story
- Characters
- Dialogue 
- Quests

Although many people who worked on Fallout: New Vegas have left Obsidian BUT the project director &amp; lead designer of Fallout: New Vegas is still at Obsidian, Josh Sawyer. 

You may still ask why not just Obsidian? Well, how long do you think we have to wait for a new Fallout game; BGS is working on Starfield and Obsidian on DLC for The Outer Worlds?

Both were large side quests and both teased the existence of a larger world and powerful entities outside the current map. 

Larger World: 

* Fallout 3 teased the Commonwealth,
* Lorenzo's story teases the existence of a buried ancient civilization that was discovered somewhere in the middle east. Granted it's not very convenient geographically speaking, but there's no reason why such a powerful civilization wouldn't have expanded across the entire planet, with ruins buried deep beneath the rocky mountains or the sands of New Mexico (for example) and unearthed by nuclear explosions. In addition, other pieces of content in both F3 and F4 already hint at the presence of that civilization in north America. 

Powerful enemies:

* Fallout 3 teased the existence of a highly advanced society capable of creating artificial humans and with the resources to hunt them down hundreds of miles away were they to escape. Those synths hunters turned out to work for The Institute. 
* Lorenzo's story introduces us to a family of immortals whose patriarch is a mind controlling super human who managed to tap into untold powers. Sure, you can ""kill"" Lorenzo in Fallout 4 ... but what does death mean to someone who messed with Cosmic horrors?

The last argument why it could, is that a lot of traditional villains have already been explored in the previous games. Mutant army, Genocidal government (x2), Imperialistic democracy, Tyranny, Mad scientist/billionaire, Robot uprising (If you consider Fallout tactics), Synthetic domination, Deadly Sentient Virus, ""Dragons"" (Scorch beasts) ... which kind of leave aliens, cosmic horror and, maybe, a ghoul uprising, as unexplored ideas.

 **The Brotherhood of Steel**: They are ordered and possess the ability to protect plenty of citizens of the Commonwealth simply because of their power armor and weaponry. They do seem like they could help the most people, but they're very radical. I mean, Maxson sees Synths as abominations, super mutants as abominations (I don't disagree with him there) and basically wants a pure and safe Commonwealth. Not a bad idea, right? Well it would be if they didn't also hate the Railroad for some reason. It's not like The Railroad are producing Synths. They simply want to protect the ones that want to be free. But that isn't allowed in Maxson's Commonwealth, and many other BOS members share that sentiment. 

 **The Railroad**: While I think any free Synth has the right to live if they so choose, the Railroad as an organization are a bit too shortsighted in my opinion. Their only mission is to protect and save Synths. That's it. Not help the people of the Commonwealth or build a better world, just save Synths. Again, very shortsighted in my opinion. 

**The Minutemen**: They seem to be the most moral faction thus far, wanting to help settlers and make the Commonwealth a better place. But they are extremely underarmed and stretched very thin. Sure, they could make more bases around the Commonwealth, but who's going to man them? Who's supplying the ammo and food to keep the men and women stocked? They don't seem to be able to answer this question yet. 

**The Institute**: This one really isn't even a choice. I mean sure, they have the technology and capability to help many many people, but they just won't. They'd rather just preserve their way of life and let the problems of the Commonwealth sort itself out while they continue their work. Sure, that could all change with you as the director. But do you really think everyone's going to be onboard with you? Also, child kidnappings and what they did to Virgil. To say that's cruel is an understatement.

275,This is what the next Fallout Game should be,1601412277,"So I've posted this idea only twice in the comments section and I wanted to get a wider feedback on the idea and see what most of you think. Since I see so many ideas being thrown out there.

The next Fallout game should not be Fallout 5. It should be a spinoff. Now hear me out.

Picture this. A Linear RPG spinoff.

 Instead of a vault dweller, a colonist for a trading company in the NCR is aboard a ship and on its way to a newly Annexed State of Alaska. He/she is sent as a liason for the Company to established a new International Trading Route with the Asian Continent. The Bering Strait becomes the new Silk Road essentially.

However, Alaska is not as peaceful or as cracked up as he might think. The people of Alaska are remnants of people that lived in China. New friends and enemies are made as companies, scavvers, raiders, and people of Alaska fight for who controls the new Silk Road. The only thing that could throw a wrench in everyone's plans is old enemy that had been long forgotten. One that survived the destruction of an off shore Oil Rig. 

Another  option was to have someone from Project Purity sail to some part of  England or France. I don't have a narrative for this yet.

All in all the point of this spinoff RPG in the Fallout Universe would be to open up some possibilities for future games outside of America. This would allow a Fallout 5 or 6 to be introduced in this way and not be as jarring to its audience. This would expand the Fallout Universe even more and create a ton of possibilities for where the Franchise is now.

333,For the NV fans out there here's some nostalgia,1601352005,"To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
""He's an outlaw loose and runnin'"", came a whisper from each lip
""And he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip""
""Big iron on his hip""
In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more
Now the stranger started talkin' made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He was here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red
Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry, men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
Now the morning passed so quickly it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
Folks were watchin' from the windows
Every body held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
About to meet his death
There was twenty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather for a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered 'round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin' but he made one fatal slip

Big iron on his hip

I seem to remember there being the option to either tell or not tell the Brotherhood about the Synths there. 

Let's suppose you opt not to tell them and instead lie about Far Harbor's existence. Would this not make siding with the Brotherhood a bit regrettable if you actually care about Synths? Because I mean they're not idiots. They'll find the place eventually and probably hate you for lying to them.

393,(FO5) A propsal on what Fallout 5 could be,1601310390,"   
  Fallout 5 takes place in the lower Peninsula of Michigan now referred to as only ""The Peninsula"" 20 years after Fallout 4 takes place. The nuclear war has taken its toll on this region. It is a tundra wasteland with radiation blizzards that make it nearly inhospitable. To make matters worse it is being invaded by a group calling themselves ""The Kleptocrats"" who have already taken control of the Upper Peninsula are trying to invade the Lower Peninsula. You are the one known as ""The Exiled One"" You were exiled from Vault 123. An obscure but working vault concept where only families with newborn children were allowed in. The parents were killed and the children were raised by robots and lead to believe that there is nothing outside the vault and that the vault was the world. You attempt to lead a coup against the Overseer (the messianic figure in the minds of the vault residents) only to find out that he is on the top floor of the facility then you are ""fed"" as a sacrifice to the elevator that is remote operated by the overseer. You are then kicked out of the vault and left to roam the Peninsula. Throughout the game you are being hunted by the Kleptocrats and their soldiers. You don't know why but you join up with one of 4 factions in order to kick them out of the Lower Peninsula and send them back to the Upper Peninsula where they have almost complete control. Faction one is known as the Egoists, a faction inspired by the teachings of Max Sternier. They serve as the indestructible ""Yes man faction"" since they are only united by their ideology. You cannot destoy them because they have no leader and their faction represents an idea. The second faction you can join is called the Remnant, this faction composes the surviving members of The Enclave and they are the most directly confrontational toward the Kleptocrats. The third is the Oathkeepers, a group of scientists and doctors trying to cure the New Plague which has ravenged the Upper Peninsula, giving the Kleptocrats almost complete control there since they are the only ones who possess a known temporary treatment to the New Plague. And the final is the Brotherhood, who is in the Peninsulas in order to wipe out the Remnant and the Kleptocrats, along with containing the New Plague and the people of The Peninsulas so they don't leave and spread the virus. As you try to push out the Kleptocrats you learn more about who they really are and once you get to their main base in the Lower Peninsula (an old military installation) you are given the chance to join them and learn who they really are. The Kleptocrats are ex-members of the Enclave who grew disenfranchised with the way the Enclave went about the cleanup. So the Kleptocrats split from the Enclave after it was destroyed and moved their operation to the Upper Peninsula. The Kleptocrats believe no direct action has to be taken against the people of the wasteland, no major genocide needs to be enacted to purify the United States. Rather that they can be lead to their own destruction by their instincts alone. The Kleptocrats use this treatment to the new plague to get wastelanders to submit to them by using the treatment to the New Plague as leverage against them, forcing them to destroy their former friends and allies and do their bidding. If they refuse, their commands and missions they are left to die. At one point ""The Boss"" of the Kleptocrats quotes Sun Tzu by stating "" The opportunity to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself."" The Kleptocrats' base in the Lower Peninsula can be destroyed ending the main game campaign causing them to cut their losses and cease their campaign in the Lower Peninsula.   
  Now for the DLC. As you have read the Kleptocrats main base known as the Ivory tower is in the Upper Pennisula meaning you have to travel there to finish them off for good. Unless you decided to slide with them, then you are there to wipe out settlements and civilians who oppose the Kleptocrats. On arrival you find a dying society where the infection is killing everyone but the Kleptocrats and those who have chosen to collaborate with the Kleptocrats. This means that all the Kleptocrat troops you mowed down were simply trying to get temporary treatment for the New Plague The DLC story progresses as such, The Egoists and the Brotherhood are there to destroy the Kleptocrats. While the Oathkeepers are interested in capturing the Ivory Tower so that they can syntheize the treatment and work on a cure to save Upper Pennisula. As in the original Fallout game, your time is limited and if you don't act quickly more and more rebellious settlemtents will die out leaving only the Kleptocrats and their collaborators left alive. Making it so you have no choice but to destroy the Kleptocrats and take their treatment to an essential scientist npc or the Oathkeepers You uncover when infiltrating the Ivory Tower the Kleptocrats biggest secret. They own a powerful piece of pre-war tech, the Innsbruck. This ship was a failed U.S. teleportation experiment that caused the crew to fuse with the ship and travel through time with the technology. The Kleptocrats discovered the ship and reversed engineered the time travel device, making a micro version of it they use to travel into the future and even the past. When you confront the Boss face to face. He offers to transport you back intime to before the war, a lie by the way. You are actually transported back to Vault 123 where the Kleptocrats' soldiers are slaughtering the vault. You than then go back and finish off or capture the Ivory Tower ending the Kleptocrats once and for all. The true reason they want to destroy you is because they sent their agent inside the time travel device and saw you destroy the Ivory Tower.   
  A few new game mechanics. You can capture settlements for your faction by clearing out or intimating and demanding tribute from the settlers the same way you do in Nuka World. Every faction has this ability. And all you need to do to take a settlement is to either threaten them via charisma check or kill the settlers and place a flag indicating your faction controls the area. Dissimilar to Nuka World, you can do this without having to do a quest and can do this to almost every settlement. Settlements are marked in terms of which faction controls them and settlements of destroyed factions become rogue, prime for conquest. Raiders can also capture settlements. The more settlements you have, the more allies you can summon by using a distress device such as a flare gun. Another one would be an approval bar above the heads of companions, the higher the bar, the better relationship status you have with the companion. On the Pip-Boy, Faction approval is also marked. It will stay stagnant unless you do something to upset them, such as taking their settlements, acts of aggression, or taking certain quests from other factions, this disapproval will show via reminder when you are about to engage or have engaged in such behavior on the side then it will lower (The Egoists are the only faction who are not subjected to this system, the Egoist companion is also a blank slate, not caring about what you do) The Egoists do not care because you are acting in your own interest. There is also to be a feature where you will be told via the notification side of the screen about how many junk items you need to craft a marked item. In FO5 you will be able to mark a mod for crafting automatically unmarking the resources you have enough of in order to create it,   
  For the DLC by the way, you will be notified on the side when a settlement ""dies out""

397,What do you guys think of my idea of an enemy?,1601308638,"The Appalachian Wildmen serve no one and are secluded people who typically keep to themselves. They can be found amuck the forests of Appalachia but are extremely dangerous when encountered. Unlike other foes, they prefer to use stealth tactics and have an insanely high perception. They know the lands better than anyone and are equipped with some gear usually made from hide that comes from a variety of animals, usually modified to help them keep a low profile and blend in with the wilderness. There are scripted encounters where they lay an ambush on one of the main roads, and a player can be ambushed by one. Sometimes there are groups of Wildmen working together, but it’s a rare encounter. 

Variants

Wildmen can be found anywhere where there is a forest, with the most popular regions being The Forest and The Savage Divide. Two different variants of Wildmen are within The Mire and Cranberry Bog and are called Swampmen and Bogmen. 

Swampmen

Swampmen are usually found near or in rivers and ponds. They typically lie in wait for someone to pass by, then attack them relentlessly with a melee weapon. Should the person get too far when under attack, they take out a shotgun and charge at the target while shooting. Once they get close enough again, they will continue using melee attacks which can stagger opponents consistently. What they use to hide themselves is a ghillie suit covered in vines and moss in order to conceal themselves in the water, using a special breathing apparatus that allows them to stay submerged for long periods of time. They are very high level and a major threat should they get close. A specialty that Swampmen have is the “War Cry” ability, which gives a -25% armor debuff and is used right after they run out of the water to ambush their target, lasting for around 1 minute. The war cry itself isn’t really a cry but a scream, that is amplified by the apparatus they where to make it sound more akin to the Aztec Death Whistle. In case you don’t know what that sounds like:  Bogmen

Bogmen rises in the Cranberry Bog and can be encountered near areas where the brush is high or have trees. They typically like to fire at their targets stealthily using high calibre sniper rifles with a unique suppressor that makes almost no noise. The gear they wear helps them stay hidden from scorched and scorchedbeasts, while also protecting them from the plague. They will typically aim for the head and limbs of a character. Should you get close enough, however, they will take out a Scorchbeast knife tooth and charge at the player and attack furiously. The ability they have is the “Bloodrage” ability, making them more and more aggressive as they lose health. They gain an initial 5% attack speed and damage boost, and max out at 30% attack speed and damage boost. Before they attack you, they will attempt to cripple you by targeting your legs and firing at them in order to prevent you from running, making you an easy target to pick off. They gain a 20% cripple bonus while attempting to do so when you are not close enough.

Console command to check run speed?,1601290128,"I'm trying to figure out how run speed is calculated in Bethesda's Fallout and Elder Scrolls games (Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3, New Vegas, Fallout 4). Specifically I'm playing Fallout 3 right now and wondering what the run speed formula is in that game.

A quick Google search turns up a ton of inconsistent responses, and none of them seem to have any evidence. The things that I see most commonly said to affect run speed are:

* Agility stat
* Endurance stat
* Total carry weight
* (Current carry weight) / (Total carry weight)
* Weight of all equipped weapons and armor
* Weight of currently raised weapon

Has anyone ever figured out exactly what the run speed formula is in Fallout 3 or any other Bethesda Fallout/Elder Scrolls game? Is there someone you can see it in the GECK/Creation Kit?

I think there are a few reasons, in skyrim you get so many quests from just going to a new town as people will run up to you or guards will give you info. The only thing i can think of in F4 like this is entering diamond city. Also, Skyrim makes looting and killing hard enemies rewarding with unique apparel and weapons whereas in fallout, it feels like the same weapons or armour but sometimes you feel rewarded due to a unique perk. Nothing looks unique and I never felt badass like i do in Skyrim and even older fallouts. I think what shows this is that I never even wanted to go third person like I did in those other games so I could see my character. I want to love F4 because I think it does factions greatly, much better than skyrim as you must pick between conflicting factions.

Types of characters or individual character?

Companies (pre/post war), organizations, and/or factions?

Narrative beats and/or quests? 

Sound and/or music? 

Items?

That sort of thing.

What do you think people aren't talking about but should be? Personally I think the Fallout's horror influences are superb. The blend of the ""end of the world"" and ""fear of the unknown"" and ""dread"" together uniquely create a lot of subtle but interesting horror elements throughout the series. From the Necropolis from Fallout 1 to the Lonesome Road's bleakness to Far Harbors obvious Lovecraft influenced themes. I think the game does a great job of be horrfic without the need for jumpscares (aside from the Spore carrier from Vault 22)

Addtionally I think Fallouts portrayal of drugs and alcohol is surprisingly pretty good. Characters use for fun, to cope, to relax, some people over-do it, some people don't, there are folks that see it as a business, some people see it a vice. It's a very mature understanding of drugs and i don't see many games treating drugs and alcohol with any amount of nuance.",Fallout,booster_silver,False,/r/Fallout/comments/j10sc0/what_are_in_your_opinion_the_underrated/,1

460,(FO5) A Suggestion for Fallout 5's Story,1601237253,"Fallout 5 takes place in the lower Peninsula of Michigan now referred to as only ""The Peninsula""  20 years after Fallout 4 takes place. The nuclear war has taken its toll on this region. It is a tundra wasteland with irradiated blizzards and green snow that make it nearly inhospitable. To make matters worse it is being invaded by a group calling themselves ""The Kleptocrats"" who have already taken control of the Upper Peninsula are trying to invade the Lower Peninsula. You are the one known as ""The Exiled One"" You were exiled from Vault 123. An obscure but working vault concept where only familes with newborn children were allowed in. The parents were killed and the children were raised by robots and lead to believe that there is nothing outside the vault. You attempt to lead a coup against the Overseer (the messianic figure in the minds of the vault residents) only to find out that he is on the top floor of the facility then you are ""fed"" as a sacrifice to the elevator that is remote operated by the overseer. You are then kicked out of the vault and left to roam the Peninsula. Throughout the game you are being hunted by the Kleptocrats and their soldiers. You don't know why but you join up with one of 4 factions in order to kick them out of the Lower Peninsula and send them back to the Upper Peninsula where they have almost complete control. Faction one is known as the Egoists, a faction inspired by the teachings of Max Sternier. They serve as the indestructible ""Yes man faction"" since they are only united by their ideology. You cannot destoy them because they have no leader and their faction represents an idea. The second faction you can join is called the Remnant, this faction composes the surviving members of The Enclave and they are the most directly confrontational toward the Kleptocrats. The third is the Oathkeepers, a group of scientists and doctors trying to cure the New Plague which has revenged the Upper Peninsula, giving the Kleptocrats almost complete control there since they are the only ones who possess a known cure to the New Plague. And the final is the Brotherhood, who is in the Peninsulas in order to wipe out the Remnant and the Kleptocrats, along with containing the New Plague and the people of The Peninsulas so they don't leave and spread the virus. As you try to push out the Kleptocrats you learn more about who they really are and once you get to their main base in the Lower Peninsula (an old military installation) you are given the chance to join them and learn who they really are. The Kleptocrats are ex-members of the Enclave who grew disenfranchised with the way the Enclave went about the cleanup. So the Kleptocrats split from the Enclave after it was destroyed and moved their operation to the Upper Peninsula.  The Kleptocrats believe no direct action has to be taken against the people of the wasteland, no major genocide needs to be enacted to purify the United States. Rather that they can be lead to their own destruction by their instincts alone. The Kleptocrats use resources and caps to get wastelanders to submit to them by bribery or extortion, forcing them to  destroy their former friends and allies. If they refuse, their resources are taken away and they are left to die. At one point ""The Boss"" of the Kleptocrats quotes Sun Tzu by stating "" The opportunity to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself."" The Kleptocrats' base in the Lower Peninsula can be destroyed ending the main game campaign causing them to cut their losses and cease their campaign in the Lower Peninsula. 

Now for the DLC. As you have read the Kleptocrats main base known as the Ivory tower is in the Upper Pennisula meaning you have to travel there to finish them off for good. On arrival you find a dying society where the infection is killing everyone but the Kleptocrats and their troops, this is because the Kleptocrats are the only ones offering a cure. In exchange the people are forced to be implanted with a brain chip and serve in the Kleptocrats' army. This means that the majority of the people you had mowed down in the main game were fighting you for the survival of their famlies. Arriving here you are hated for your actions, finding you have destroyed many families. Most civilians are outright verballly hostile to you for this, unless you join the Kleptocrats in which case they fear you. The DLC story progresses as such, The Egoists and the Brotherhood are there to destroy the Kleptocrats. While the Oathkeepers are interested in  capturing the Ivory Tower so that they can syntheize the cure and save the Upper Pennisula. As in the original Fallout game, your time is limited and if you don't act quickly the entire Upper Pennisula will die out leaving only Super Mutants and the Kleptocrats alive. You uncover when infitrating the Ivory Tower that the reason the Kleptocrats were hunting you at first was because they own a powerful piece of pre-war tech, the Innsbruck. This ship was a failed U.S. teleportation experiment that caused the crew to fuse with the ship and travel through time with the technology. The Kleptocrats discovered the ship and reversed engineered the time travel device, making a micro version of it they use to travel into the future and even the past. When you confront the Boss face to face. He offers to transport you back intime to before the war, a lie by the way. You are actually transported back to Vault 123 where the Kleptocrats soldiers are slaughtering the vault. You than then go back and finish off or capture the Ivory Tower ending the Kleptocrats once and for all.

&amp;#x200B;

A few new game mechanics. You can capture settlements for your faction by clearing out or intimating and demanding tribute from the settlers the same way you do in Nuka World. Every faction has this ability. And all you need to do to take a settlement is to either threaten them via charisma check or kill the settlers and place a flag indicating your faction controls the area. Dissimilar to Nuka World, you can do this without having to do a quest and can do this to almost every settlement.  Settlements are marked in terms of which faction controls them and settlements of destroyed factions become rogue, prime for conquest. Raiders can also capture settlements. The more settlements you have, the more allies you can summon by using a distress device such as a flare gun.

Another one would be an approval bar above the heads of companions, the higher the bar, the better relationship status you have with the companion. On the Pip-Boy, Faction approval is also marked. It will stay stagnant unless you do something to upset them, such as taking their settlements, acts of aggression, or taking certain quests from other factions, this disapproval will show via reminder when you are about to engage or have engaged in such behavior on the side then it will lower (The Egoists are the only faction who are not subjected to this system, the Egoist companion is also a blank slate, not caring about what you do) The Egoists do not care because you are acting in your own interest. There is also to be a feature where you will be told via the notification side of the screen about how many junk items you need to craft a marked item. In FO5 you will be able to mark a mod for crafting automatically unmarking the resources you have enough of in order to create it,

Nick Valentine is an amazing character but having him and side quest to keep up the noir theming is plain cruel.

477,"My opinion of fallout 3,nv and 4",1601224867," 

Hey all, so i just finished playing all modern fallouts, plus watched fallout 1 and 2 full gameplay with all choices shown (i always fell asleep watching 2, but i got a solid idea of what it was)

Anyways, I must first confess, my fov of all the Fallout games is Fallout 4, because the gameplay loop is just amazing, the shooting, exploration, the map, it all just feels good, plus the mod pushes it into legendary status (like skyrim). I will also admit, i don't like the wild west theme, i hate it, yet i decided to push through NV, and enjoyed it.

moving on:

Fallout 3 felt a lot like oblivion, it was fun, enjoyable, but nothing compared to Fallout 1 imo. That is, Fallout 3 is trying to simulate fallout 1 wasteland with an anarchic environment and no strong factions to enforce rules. it wasn't bad, it was alright. just, not as series, not as gritty, but that's a problem with all the modern fallout games. 7/10

fallout NV: i will profess, i never wanted it to play it, but everyone online praises it as the golden apple of eden. Now, me disliking the wild west theme coupled with the janky combat u would think i would hate it, but no... i loved the story and writing, but everything else imo falls short. the map is HUGE and empty, running between objectives is just boring, i had to use sgtm command to speed it up. I loved the factions of vegas quests,  they were really fun and immersive. helping out the ghouls in come fly with me was enjoyable, if you don't count the running. I personally am not a fan of fixed speech checks, I think it turns from something that is supposed to be dynamic in nature and risky to feel like another skill... I'm aware it was made to stop the quick save quick load abuse, but I aint convinced, speech needs to be fluid and risky not a fixed number. so yeah, it was fun, writing and story really good, everything else was meh... BROWN/10 (seriesly tho its a 7/10)

fallout 4 was fun all around experience for me, the gameplay is superb, enjoyed the story and quests (i'm not a big RP guy, and usually stick with the narrative favored or pointed towards by devs)

The world and map is beautiful to explore and discover any of the hidden stories. i enjoyed the companions (NICk and DANSE), i do hate that the ending is not as fleshed out, but i appreciate letting me continue after the end ""slides'' (if you can call them that lol) (9/10) it's the highest because the most important part for me (the gameplay and exploration) is best.

finally when it comes to fo1 and 2, i though 1 was better felt more fallouty than the secound, even though 2 has a better main story, i juist felt like the world of FO1 was more series dark and immersive, all the oranized crime, drugs and sex in 2 makes it, i dont know, not to my liking.

When fallout 4 came out and they literally copy pasted most of galaxy news radio with a few new ones here and there. It was okay I could just about manage. It was annoying but I could try loosely explaining it lorewise.

Then 76 does the exact same thing with more rehashed fallout 3 music and some tracks from 4. I can't even listen to the radio now. 
If I do in 76 I end up pressing it, hear butcher Pete for the 10000th time and it goes straight back off, only rarely am I treated to those great new ones. I keep having to switch it off for a few songs.

There was a great thing that the mod Fallout New California did and its stuck with me ever since. They had an NCR Radio station where the DJ would actually elaborate on how the track was found and it added such depth to the radio. I think he talks about how the holotape was found by a ranger in a burnt out car. Such a great way to add music 

Why can't Bethesda think more on these lines. There's so many tracks they could add and it seems like they're either being lazy or can't find any.

Firstly you have a completely different style of city and architecture, which makes the game visually different.

Narrow streets, ancient catacombs, partially submerged buildings, travelling by canal - and the canals themselves filled with amphibious zombies (and worse!) who leap out of the water to drag unwary victims to a drowning death in radioactive water. 

The narrow streets and canals make brilliant places for ambushes and there would be a lot more verticality to the game.

I believe that Point Lookout is an excellent dlc and has one of the best main quest lines of any fallout dlc, along with excellent side quests, a very nice new area to explore, interesting new enemies and weapons, and an experience not found anywhere else in fallout 3. My one and only problem with point lookout is that it is too short, likely because it’s just a dlc. If it had just one or two more quests I would say it’s perfect.

514,(SPOILERS) My Faction Choices and Why,1601171583,"Ok, so I play Xbox One, and Id like to make a psa about valuable info involved with which route I take with factions and why. This information is not readily available anywhere obvious when googling endings to decide from, so this may help people find their ultimate playthrough.

First off, ALWAYS DO NUKAWORLD FIRST and get Gages perk and Raider Outposts perk before you even enter the museum of freedom. This way you can still help Minutemen and get Prestons perk. If gages final perk speach bugs out after completing Nuka World, have him as a follower, save outside museum of freedom, enter the museum of freedom with Gage, kill the raiders on the first floor ONLY, then exit the museum of freedom. This has triggered Gages final alignment speech more than once for me.

Now, let me start with an opinion on Ballistic Weave. It is unrealistically overpowered and cheesey. Ok, now I start tradecraft, get the deliverer and keep carringtons prototype for myself. Then, find the institute after becoming allied with both BOS and Minutemen and getting Danse and Garvy perks. Complete mankind redefined, failing tradecraft, do plugging a leak to get Liam's Glasses, probably the only eyewear with a special bonuses, one of which being 2 int so more XP. 

Institute destroys railroad and BOS, so murder and loot both places thoroughly. Institute also has the better rewards, power armor paint, teleport, synth grenades, plus many more synths to find around so much better chance at finding full heavy synth armor. Minutemen just feels more goodguy and leaves railroad alone only, killing BOS and Institute, which is pointless because youve already given up ballistic weave, the only great thing the RR has to give you.

Now you have a pair of intelligence glasses that alot of players dont even know exist, every follower perk besides Deacons perk, Gage and Garvey remain allied followers, new power armor paint and teleport for survival, minutemen and institute remain allied, heavy synth armor, alllll at the cost of Ballistic Weave, Deacon, and a very small portion of your soul!

518,I took all those future Fallout location posts and made one condensed post.,1601164966,"This sub gets flooded by location posts all the time and I was curious what some of the more popular suggestions were. Here I took the most popular Landmarks, Creatures, Factions, and DLC suggestions and made a little list. I also added some Quest options, Events and random items that popped up, but those are per city/state and not all locations had similar info.

Hawaii and Atlanta were excluded due to lack of info. People say they like the idea but no one gives ideas about it, even in the posts dedicated to them. I excluded Australia, London and China for the same reasons but also because they tend to not be favored in this sub.

Comment any suggestions, ideas, or concerns.

Also, when I make her unequip it, she re-eqips it. It's not exactly ruining my experience, but it's kind of annoying. Before anyone asks, no, she has no modded items, nor any changes to her ai or stats, and I have no armor mods, so I don't know why it's happening. Only way I think I could fix it is to get an item which takes up the armor slot that the collar uses, making her unequip it, though she might just re-equip it.

1) Install Fallout 3

2) The game will simply not open. After a bit of searching you'll find this is because you need GFWL (Games For Windows Live) installed.

3) Download the GFWL installer and there will be no network connection -- Installation will fail.

4) Get excited when you see there's a GFWL disabler.

5) Find out that you need to have run the game and have an existing fallout3.ini file to run the disabler.

6) Create an empty .ini file to trick the app into recognising the .ini file. 

7) Successfully ""Disable GFWL""

8) Double-click Fallout3.exe (or FOSE_loader), pulse rate increasing at the sight of a black window... 

9) Nothing

Even if this is a fixable issue, any new player looking to play through Fallout 3 is more than likely going to run into this issue, effectively disabling the game for use by all but the most determined, and rendering the Steam store purchase nothing but a non-product.

534,"First time playing Fallout New Vegas, looking for some advice!",1601148691,"As someone who absolutely loves the entire concept of the Fallout games, I've always found it very difficult to get far into the games because of the difficulty. I've played New Vegas years ago and have played a bit of Fallout 3, which I really enjoyed because it reminded me a lot of Skyrim, but again I never made it too far into both games. I think the difficulty is what keeps me from getting too far. Both times I only make it just outside of the starting towns and then end up dying too much and losing interest. 

So last night I tried getting into Fallout New Vegas for the first time on PC (having tried it on Xbox before) and found myself once again killed by a scorpion just outside of Goodsprings 20 minutes into the game. For some reason my aim is basically garbage (playing with an Xbox controller from the couch) and even with VATs I couldn't kill the thing. I'm actually not terrible when it comes to FPS games like CSGO, Overwatch etc but for some reason with Fallout I can't kill anything!

I guess what I'm asking is, how can I ""customize"" my character/the game so I can actually play it and enjoy the story, the setting and everything it has to offer? I love RPGs but I'm not a huge fan of quickpaced, overwhelming gun combat. I think that's why I enjoyed Skyrim so much, I was always melee and almost never died! Whereas in Fallout I get really freaked out by vermins and enemies coming at me/shooting at me and having to shoot them from afar. I tried going for a melee build but I feel like the game wants me to use guns early on, with the training with Sunny and everything. Am I wrong? 

One last thing - I'm considering switching from Normal to Easy or Very Easy difficulty. Any recommendations on what's best?

569,What makes a good fallout quest part 3,1601115082,"This is part 3 of what i think im my opinion makes a good fallout game sorry for any errors and if its to long.

Followers are unique to the fallout games fallout NV had some of the best companions in the fallout series fallout 4 was second best excep for nick valentine who by far is in my opinion the best followers in the sense of story not strength and health thats what i think makes good companions in fallout a good story and a quest that changes they way that they might think and feel and you helping them make a decision on what they think is the right path for them like helping raul in fallout nv deciding on if he should pick up his guns again in fallout 4 the companions were changed so you could have relationships with them and comparing to fallout 3 companions bethesda did a great job improving them if for the next fallout game they could put in the idea of companions from fallout nv with their emotions and decisions at the end of their quest with fallout 4 and its relationship options might make companions better.

Story in fallout bethesda games feels like a common thing fallout 3 your dad goes missing follow in his steps to find him fallout 4 your son goes missing follow in his kidnappers footsteps to find him fallout 76 find the overseer and follow in her footsteps in NV its you getting shot and following in the footsteps of the person who tried to kill you and getting caught up in a war for the hover dam to be far this kinda happens in fallout 4 with the institute but it kinda feels all the same i feel that they should start your story with your character entering a new land with your character having no past and working your way up to a main story i cant think of a new story they could do i just wish for somthing different.

Factions in fallout have alwats been a thing in fallout 3 and 4 the brotherhood of steel is the most powerful army you could possibly find and are part of the main story in the sense that you need to have the brotherhood of steel help you defeat the enclave and institute but fallout 4kinda changed this with different endings but i want factions that dont really become invloved in the main story like the followers of the apocalypse i want factions like those but i also would like an entire new faction that originated from other factions like if a new army was formed from some NCR deserters but those are just my opinions on factions

594,Fallout 76 is a MISERABLE Grind,1601083305,"I'm writing this post for all of the people who ask every other day on here if Fallout 76 is worth trying.

The bugs? Sure, they are still there, but not too bad anymore. The quests? Wastelanders is pretty damn fun and the story is well written. Graphics? Actually pretty decent and the game runs fairly well (with a bit of lag at least on PS4 Pro though). 

BUT MY GOD, I hate the grind of this game. Your weapons break every five minutes (at least it feels like that), your armor breaks way way faster than any previous Fallout, and you are CONSTANTLY thirsty or hungry. 
And, assuming you haven't played it yet, you will say ""oh well just loot around the world"" -- no, they have reduced the amount of loot in the game (ammo, food, health packs, etc.). It costs caps to even fast travel or move your camp. EVERYTHING is meant to increase the grind in this game and encourage microtransactions. 

I hate this grind. No, I do not enjoy Bethesda forcing us into these survival elements. Before, these survival elements were always an option for us more casual players; now, they're forced on us. 

I love Fallout (I enjoyed 4 so much that I went back and played New Vegas and 3 -- and enjoyed them in 2020, despite their age). And, as a Fallout fan, there are a lot of awesome elements to Fallout 76, but the grind in this game makes it absolutely miserable.

Also Spoilers for Fallout 1, 2, NV
Oh, and this is my opinion so Downnvote if you feel like it's shit, comment why you think I'm wrong, and whatever else you wanna say. Or upvote if you want it to be heard, idc

Fallout NV2 is the worst idea. In fact, any Fallout game (at least with multiple choices) taking place in the same map as a previous game is terrible. 
First off, it kills that illusion of choice. We don't know much what happened in the end of NV, nothing says what endings were 100% cannon, so we feel like maybe our ending was the proper one. 
In Fallout 2, the NCR, Military Base, and Vault 13 are all previously from Fallout 1, but there's a reason I ""allow"" that (Like I have a say in what can and can't be Fallout lmao) 

In Fallout 1, they don't tell you what happens to your Vault, and every ending but the Mutant ending is kinda canon. The BoS, Necropolis, and such are never mentioned. (Correct me anytime if I'm wrong)
The NCR and saving Tandi are probably the only two things cannon. 
Whatever, my point is that the endings are mostly vague on what's cannon, so your play through of the next game can be sort of a continuation of the previous Fallout. 

In a ""New Vegas 2"" I'm assuming we'd be in the Mojave again playing as say, ""The Warrior"" (idk I'm not a team of writers and I'm doing this as a placeholder) a tribal who's looking to make some money for his tribe to survive. (Not bad if you think about building a settlement town) 
He wanders the exact same map running into the Post NV factions. Maybe, the Neo Legionaries, Greater Kahns, the super imperialist NCR, and the sinless, no gambling New New Vegas. Maybe the main idea is corruption of non democratically elected power. Cool story, cool ideas, but it ain't working.
It'd kill the emerson of: This is the world I, the courier, created. I defeated the legion, I helped Jacobstown, and I liberated New Vegas, etc, etc. 
Not only that, but wouldn't wandering the same map feel a little boring? A remake is one thing, but revisiting... nah.

605,So hey the Great Khans should be the focus of the next Fallout,1601075651,"Ok so I know nothing is set in stone but with all the dust stirred up by the deal with Microsoft and renewed hope in another Obsidian Fallout, I figured I’d throw my loose ideas out there. 

The Great Khans have SO much potential to be a major faction after one of their endings in NV. And yes I think they should establish canon endings. Keeping it obscure works for TES because of the weird ass metaphysical background it has but I feel like Fallout’s setting absolutely needs to progress the world and story. But the Legion is going to collapse without Caesar no matter what. That’s gonna create a massive power vacuum that a burgeoning large scale raider faction can fill. The idea of the Khans carving out a brutal empire on the plains like their namesake is just beautiful to me. They could easily take over northern legion territory. If they got a foothold in the region the NCR would have a much bigger threat across the Colorado this time. 

So the setup is basically the aftermath caused in southern Colorado, northern New Mexico, and Texas by Caesar’s death. He survived New Vegas but his worsening health and the stress of his absolute failure wore on him and he kicked the bucket. The Legion splintered just like Rome and was divided into factions while the NCR runs back to their territory to lick their wounds after Vegas became independent. The Khans migrate northeast away from their biggest threats and easily steam roll the raider gangs. And the leadership took a page from Caesar’s book. Not just wiping out their enemies but integrating their tribes into their own and teaching them their ways. 

Years later the Khans are the dominant power in the region. The NCR learned it’s lesson after overextending into Nevada and have moved focus to consolidating power in their established territory and slowly pressing north up the coast. Legion territory has degenerated into constantly shifting borders of the splinter factions and bloody skirmishes between the legate warlords. As the Khans push south the threat of them establishing a foothold that could put them in a position to take the Southwest is a rising threat that the NCR wants to prevent. Instead of trying to force their borders East to meet the Khans in open war, they station ranger outposts far beyond their reach to operate independently towards the goal of undermining rapid Khan expansion. 


The NCR as a whole won’t be a major faction in the game. You’d only interact with one of these outposts doing missions for and with the spec ops rangers there. Working against the Khans and even helping strengthen the local raider gangs and Legion remnant factions in the area to help oppose the new major enemy and serve as a buffer between NCR and Khan land. Basically the NCR’s equivalent of the Cold War. 


Or on the other side you could help the Khans conquer the region by either beating down the smaller factions or uniting them under a Khan banner. And the individual raider gangs need to be truly fleshed out. Fallout 4 took a good step in that direction but you need to actually be able to interact with them in ways outside combat. Some aren’t immediately hostile to everything that moves and are open to diplomacy or making deals. Others are traditional raiders but may have a mission you can discover that makes them warm up to you or you can find a very specific bargaining chip for their specific culture.",Fallout,Brahmus168,False,/r/Fallout/comments/izucut/so_hey_the_great_khans_should_be_the_focus_of_the/,1

612,"Nearly 5 years after Fallout 4's launch and on the heels of the announcement of Bethesda's acquisition, got my 100% on Xbox today! Some notes from the field and a couple words of half-wisdom for those still trying.",1601070741,"[Proof and Stats for those interested.]( I've done it, friends. 89 levels into my survival play-through, I completed the final remaining achievement for Fallout 4 on my Xbox One S. As a longtime fan of the series, I couldn't be more proud.

**Top 3 Toughest Achievements**

1. Benevolent Leader - As I understand, this is the one that keeps most Sole Survivors from catching their own 100%. Bethesda keeps too many secrets from us in regards to settlement happiness (like the fact there's no way to make robots happy above 50, or how unassigned settlers aren't happy). The worst part by far is idling to see if your settlement changes even affect the overall happiness.  In the end, it was the 3 incredibly happy settlers of Jamaica Plain that scored the trophy for me. 2 of them worked at restaurants, one farmed, and I stuffed the workshop with excess mutfruit to make up the difference. This one required a fair amount of research.
2. Beverageer - Nuka-Xtreme's recipe being stuck in the wall of the Dry Rock Gulch theater complex hampered my progress. It was only when I found this phenomenon to be somewhat well documented that I learned to spray-n-pray the book right out of its glitched reality. If you're still patching ANYTHING, please patch this one, Bethesda.
3. Eyes on the Prize - 100,000 Nuka-Cade tickets. Some 8,000 from scavenging Nuka World, the other 92 from an unholy abomination of several hoopshots stuck together and on top of eachother. 3 hours of senseless grind and you can have it too.

**Top 3 Most Annoying Bugs**

1. Couldn't complete ""Trouble Brewin"" quest. Keeping buddy the beer-bot for myself wouldn't bring the objective to its rightful end, forced to murder questgiver Rufus Rubins.
2. Unable to confront DiMa about the nuclear launch key in the Far Harbor DLC. Forced to side with the Children of Atom when I would've liked to bring peace to the island.

**4 Hot Tips for Survival and Otherwise**

1. Killing enemies with power armor is a golden opportunity on survival mode. Blast that body, shred the armor of its remaining condition, and walk away with multiple chunks of weightless, valuable power armor. During my final play-through I could end up with dozens at a time before my next visit to a market.
2. During the quest ""Hole in the Wall"" in Vault 81, just keep the cure for yourself if you get hit with the mole rat disease. There's no shame in letting Austin die, Bethesda gave us no other out. If you leave with the infection as I did, your status effect bar will never be clean again. Additionally, leave your companions at the door, they can give you the disease even if you avoid being hit, a detail I overlooked.
3. I'd argue siding with the institute is more useful for survival mode than the BOS, the ability to fast travel to the M.I.T. complex from anywhere in the Commonwealth did me nothing but good. Free medical care, a clean bed, a couple visits to different merchants, and I was outta there.
4. Do ""Diamond City Blues"" ASAP. All the chem fiends out there already know what I'm talking about.

I had 7k caps and used them ALL bringing people back from the dead to keep fighting the rats.

620,"A family-related story could be really good in Fallout, if done right.",1601065303,"I have heard a lot of criticisms over my time in the Fallout community about how Fallout 3 and 4's search for their family relatives was a boring and too personal of a story to be relatable in an RPG. However, I see it as another example of Bethesda's mishaps: A great concpet with charming potential done aboslutely wrong, because of a lack of attention for detail and focus on scope over quality.

What sparked this idea was a thought Joseph Anderson had in his analysis of Fallout 4, where he suggested a path where you would redeem your son and convince him the Institute does not work and is maleficent to the Commonwealth. This would be really great and shows an element of this that could improve Fallout's current formula:

The time we spend with relatives and family and how they are close to us actually makes them an excellent reflection of who we are in a narrative and that is a resource a writer can't waste on a role-playing game. They would be the main reactivity of the main quest: Do they agree with you, whether you are morally accepted or questioned? Or do they part their ways in the end, despising what you are and what you represented for the Wasteland?

Another problem often brought by the community is the lack of relatability and care they have towards the family relative. We have two ways of resolving this: 1- Not making it about their disappearance, rather about their upbringing or how they upbring you into the Wasteland. 2- Integrating perks into story, making it flashback sequences where you learn what you have to learn and develop a relationship with your relative.

I would also like to mention how a concept such as this would tie in with the main themes of Fallout, which I intepret as the constant pursuit of war against your own. The way I phrased leaves it self-explanatory: War blinds so much it can even bring us against our own family. A tragedic approach would be nice, I guess, show the conflict between the love and care you feel for them and the required opposition for survival. Of course, the thematic resolution would be up to the player's choices.

The final note is a little pessimistic, though: Bethesda, with its current writing staff, could never pull this off.

633,What makes a good fallout game part 2,1601051019,"This is part 2 to my opinion on what makes a good fallout game sorry if there are any spelling errors and if its to long

Gameplay now gameplay in fallout nv and 4 were enjoyable and i love them both so much going behind corners to take cover from an incoming missile or sneaking up on an enemy with a knife with these aspects they are so enjoyable that its hard to not like them but their are some things that could be improved like weapon management now in fallout 4 this wasn’t really a problem and to me in NV this wasn’t a problem either but in 76 to me its like i cant go anywhere without my armor or weapons breaking in half after the first 5 minutes of repairing them and sure they did this with power armor in fallout 4 and already in NV but to me i never really used power armor unless i felt like being a giant tank that kills all i see before me but thats just my opinion apart from that other aspexts of gameplay may be used in other arguments because this oart if getting to long but to end it off I thought it was enjoyable in fallout 4, NV and 76 (kinda)

Weapons in the fallout games were always the same just a gun or a knife until NV added in modding this to me was genius having a hunting rifle with a scope extended ammo clip and better bolt is so good this would later be expanded to the next fallout games 4 and 76 games with even more customisation to them but weapons altogether in the fallout games are so good NV had some of the most fun weapons from the katana to the euclid c finder they were all so much fun to use same with 4 and 76 I always wanted a cross bow type weapon in a fallout game and a homemade rifle in fallout NV though i hatted how I couldn’t put attachments onto my unique weapons without using a mod but with 4 and 76 i can mod my unique weapons forever and thats what u think is a good thing that should be used in all fallout games a huge veriety if weapons like in 76 and the ability to mode them.

Leveling in fallout is an iconic moment for everyone maxing out your xp to get the next perk what i think is better between fallout NV,4 and 76 i think NV did it better because in fallout 4 you have to wait until a certain level until you can get the highest perk to hack or lockpick or get the next rank to weapons modding in 76 in did it a little better with just combining cards to make one big hacking or lockpicking card but in NV you can put a certain amount of points into a certain thing like survival or guns which when you do that can open up opportunities for new perks and by leveling them out so you can get the exact amount next time you level up is so good but i also would like the option to choose when i level up like in 76 and 4 because I would like to see the perks that i might be able to get before i chose fallout 4 did this well with a giant poster filled with all the perks that you might soon get in NV it didn’t feel like wow congratulations look at this it felt more like a look there you go in 76 it gas cards that you put into a certain SPECIAL stat rather than a wall of perks with certain perks under a SPECIAL stat i felt like fallout 4 did this the best but if the option of putting in the same leveling they did in NV with hacking, lovkpicking and guns then it might make fallout a little better but thats just my opinion

637,What makes a good fallout game PART 1,1601047085,"Now before i start people might disagree with me on this but this is what i think makes a good fallout game and you can hate on this as much as you want. (sorry for it being to long)

To start off I believe what makes a good fallout game is the world itself and what i mean by that is that i want to feel like im apart of the world itself rather than me being the world i dont want NOC coming up to me saying “oh my god its our saviour” no i want a world where people react in a way where they have heard of me but not directly like in Vew vegas where they say things like i hurd what you did for us rather than in other fallout games where everyone gets down on their knees and sucks your dick for what you have done for the wasteland i dont want that i wanna feel like a person in a world trying to survive rather than a god that people just worship thats how i feel about the world moving on to other stuff 

Settlement building now this is a different idea so bere i go i think on paper it sounds like a good idea but when being used it went down hill kinda fast dont get me wrong i love building bases for my settlers but it felt like there wasn’t enough and bethesda could have done so much more but they didn’t thats why mods are so useful they put things into settlement building that should have been there but weren’t but with the idea of setting up a small trading town in the waste sounds good right and other wastelanders could trade at a market you made that sounds like a good idea right well it is in my opinion thats why i enjoy fallout 76 building a little more than 4 i know what people are going to say that 76 is shit but the building idea in it is better let me explain in 76 you build a base for yourself a home possibly a trading outpost for others while in fallout 4 you have to manage water, food, beds, security and happiness its so stupid that it hurts i just want to build a house in the middle of a forest where sometimes NPC will buy stuff from me and i know you might be able to do this in fallout 4 but it doesn’t feel the same and thats my opinion on settlement building 

Quests are an iconic piece of fallout but in my opinion questing between fallout 4 and NV are for me 50/50 let me explain in 4 i like the quests but i wish their were more unique quest ideas rather than going to a place kill a raider then your done in NV this kinda was different you might do the same thing but at the end depending on what you did could effect the way people react to you with the reputation system example being taking all the bottle caps for yourself after a quest might lead to negative reputation while in 4 the NPC would just tell yku to leave if they could blend the 2 ideas together then it would work i mean sure they added the reputation system into 76 but that changes nothing you gain and lose reputation but they wont kill you if you have minus reputation i mean WTF.

The other half, the ice thin out, mist form above them and they transform into a gigantic trap, ice can break under you or strange creatures living since the war hidden from the sun attacking you. But is it better to pass by the city? It is still pretty much left untouched by the atomic disaster, the space needle is still there. But there are the factions fighting over food, heat, energy and shelter underground.

I really liked the leveling up system was really good, and I also thought the traits system was a good idea, but other than that, most of its features have been outclassed by other fallout games. Another thing I personally didn’t like was the story. it was a great idea for a plot, but it was executed poorly, and I didn’t feel any a motion throughout the game. every time I got into the game’s story and felt immersed, it would launch me into a side quest that was required for me to progress farther in the story, it totally ruined the feeling of the game.

686,I think I'm actually in love with Beckett!,1600969666,"His character is so well created. The voice acting is so smooth and sensual. He looked annoying at first but I preferred him over Sofia. I just couldn't care about her story!

So I helped Beckett out and gave him a home. Figures he would just boss me around like other companions in this game. But I was wrong.. he was so shy and awkward when I flirted with him that I just couldn't get enough of it. I didn't know I felt this way but this game let me explore a part of me I didn't think I had.

He didn't seem to want me at first so I wanted to prove him wrong. Next, days later, he asked me why I was being so nice to him. I couldn't tell him that I helped him cause he was hotter than Ward could I? But his character kept evolving. Recently he suggested he'd give me drinks on the house. Wow!!

In a fit of anger I murdered a blood raider after hearing what they had done to Becky. I didn't feel sorry, that's the man I am. But then I saw Beckett admired me for that and I felt like pillaging all the Blood eagle camps just to make him smile! Who does not like to be admired?

Yesterday Becky told me about his brother. My eyes began to water as I deftly declared my love for Beckett. I knows he cares about me so deeply.

When I found out his true feelings for me, my heart skipped a beat. I felt like I was a 16 year old boy again with my first crazy boyfriend messing about in the local park.

I find myself missing Beckett in the real world and I am just so amazed a game managed to created this feeling. Well done Bethesda!

706,DEAD MONEY and how a great atmosohere can overcome frustrating game play,1600957084,"So after being proved wrong with my initial take of HONEST HEARTS (started off bored, by the end the story of the Father of the Caves brought me to tears) I decided to venture out and explore DEAD MONEY next. 

Before starting I heard two things about DEAD MONEY

One was people saying that it was great, and tragic, and one of the best they ever did

The other was people saying fuck Dead Money, it's the worst, most annoying bullshit ever 

After playing I can definitely see both sides 

On one hand the combination of: 

-radios that can make you explode (and some you can't shoot) 

-navigating toxic red acid clouds 

-the Ghost people who are uber powerful and require you to chop up their whole body before they stay dead

-holograms you literally can't damage at all and will kill you quite quickly 

-losing all your weapons and Stimpacks at the start 

That combination I can easily see frustrating and annoying any player 

Hell there were times I was desperate to ""get back to normal"" with enemies you can actually hurt who stay dead 

On the other hand....its a DLC. It's not supposed to be as easy as the rest of the game. 

I had reached that point we all reach where all of my powerful weapons were maxed, plenty of Stimpacks, powerful armor...nothing was that much of a challenge 

So I welcomed losing almost everything and starting fresh 

For me personally it was never too overwhelming. I enjoyed how much things escalated especially when I rang the bell and the streets became flooded with Ghost People and it became a horror movie where my only goal was ESCAPE AND SURVIVE

But yeah...the beeps, the toxic gas, the unstoppable enemies did pile up...

But unlike HONEST HEARTS, DEAD MONEY managed to hook you right away with a killer premise 

The problem of course is that premise is more exciting than the game play itself 

If there is a FALLOUT TV show can you imagine how a newbie would react to the DEAD MONEY episode? 

""When an insane ex Elder takes the Courier hostage, he forces them to cooperate with a traumatized mute test subject, an untrustworthy ghoul lounge singer and a super mutant with a split personality by placing explosive collars around all their next and making them rob a casino surrounded by toxic red gas and populated by deadly holograms and monstrous ghost people"" 

Everything about that is bat shit crazy in the best way possible 

In the end I didn't keep playing because I really enjoyed being blown up or fighting Ghost People 

I kept playing because I wanted to help Dog and God reach a place of mental stability 

I kept playing because Dean Domino may have been duplicitous but he was so damn entertaining

I kept playing because I wanted to help Christine get her revenge on Father Elijah 

I kept playing because I wanted to see just what was in that vault and worth all that trouble 

And what a great twist btw. Hell it's a double twist 

Because while yes there were gold bars in there (more on that later) the real treasure of the Seirra Madre was and always has been Vera Keyes 

She was his treasure 

She was what he wanted to keep safe

She was the whole reason the Seirra Madre was built 

And she OD'd mere feet from the elevator that was made just for her voice. 

On top of all that we spend all this time fighting throw toxic acid gas and deadly holograms to get to the treasure Elijiah is so obsessed with....only to realize that the toxic acid gas and deadly holograms was the treasure that crazy bastard was after the whole damn time. 

It was the feature not the bug. 

One last note on the gold bars

I kind of wish they made it THIS close to being possible to escape with all of them 

As it is now well yeah obviously you're never gonna make it out in time with all the gold especially if you need to jump. Way too far and your collar is beeping 

If however they made it closer with no jumping involved.....give players the illusion of ""maybe you can make it out of here with everything"" 

Only to make them realize that if they want to escape.....they have to let go. 

So much to think about and chew on. I must have missed some terminals because I still have no idea what the gas is or where it came from. 

At the end of the day I loved it in SPITE of the game play, not because of it and can totally see why some people hated playing it

The atmosphere though? That chilling casino contrasting with the orange sky and red clouds? Blue ghosts roaming the streets and dark creatures with glowing green eyes hiding in the shadows? 

Bravo. 

Off to OLD WORLD BLUES next. Let me guess. Another dumb excuse to why all my weapons and Stimpacks will be gone?

714,Fallout New Vegas 2 is not a good idea,1600952009,"Posting this to generate discussions and to share my thoughts. Please don't downvote of you dont like just blast me in the comments 🥺

Fallout New Vegas basically had 4 endings, NCR, Lil Ceasers, House, and Courier. The sequel would have to have not just multiple endings but multiple beginnings to all player choices. These aren't minor changes either each choice dramatically alters New Vegas in different ways.

To have four different beginnings and four different endings would basically force them to write 16 different story lines for one game. Not even Microsoft has that kind of money.

I wish that they kept track of what ending was chosen the most, if they had to pick an ending to start the sequel with I would guess they would start it with NCR. I feel like this would kind of betray fallouts freedom of choice though. Picking and ending to Fallout:New Vegas 1 is the only way to keep the development of the game manageable.

I would rather give obsidian other projects. It would be great if they would take a approach that other titles have done where but does the works on a main title and obsidian works on a spin-off title and a fallout game comes out once every 7.  I can imagine Bethesda working on a Fallout Chicago game while obsidian works on a spin-off game that takes place in Pre-War USA.",Fallout,prue219,False,/r/Fallout/comments/iywoz8/fallout_new_vegas_2_is_not_a_good_idea/,1
715,New Vegas Disguise bug?,1600950075,"Not sure if this is a big or just a poorly thought out feature. I’m trying to do an NCR playthrough and just got some Ranger combat armour to wear. Now it says I’m disguised as NCR and all my reputations are different, NCR has gone from Idolized to neutral .

I just went to red rock to talk to the khan’s and everyone in the longhouse instantly aggroed, even though it showed reputation as friendly mercenary or something. Completing the quest after wiping them out actually gave me fame with them so now I’m a soft headed devil? 

Why is the system such a mess and why do disguises mess with fame instead of just hiding infamy? Are the Khan’s meant to aggro you if you’re disguised as NCR or did they just want to kill Boone?

721,I had a concept for a new fallout. Would love feedback!,1600945709,"I am an avid lover of the fallout franchise having played most of the games now multiple times over. My friends have played 4 and 76. We have been talking and we came up with an idea we believe is rather cool. It would be multiplayer but not in the way 76 is.

The game takes place in either Russia so that we can see what it was like on the other side of the war and the nukes. Or it would take place in los-angeles. You would play as a group that has recently left the vault and are creating a society and the main concept of the game is the importance of life. Your group can start off in many directions: Traders, Bounty hunters, Mercenaries etc. although as you progress through the wasteland you can change your clan's actions and ideologies.

There are multiple, more powerful factions in the world, you can join them or you can rise up the ranks and they join you or you can wipe them out. There will be real storylines between the factions and they will go to bloody combat with each other in certain situations. Your group could be solidarity, or team up with others etc. The main points of the game are about becoming powerful and creating your society, whether that be good, bad or morally ambiguous.

The multiplayer aspect works as such. The game operates outside of your main base as a solo, groups of 2-4 (Online friends or the A.I) or, when you are strong enough, battalions. As this is the case the people in the group would have a mind of their own and make decisions that will affect the wasteland as you know it. For example, let's say a member of your crew goes and robs a factions shop. They will become wanted by that group and depending on the severity, they may want their head. You then have the option to exile them, hand them over to the enemy, or stand by them and go to conflict and start a faction war. So in total they could make decisions but there are ways to circumvent it. The factions are based as a offline experience, so there would be no multiplayer enemy factions to fight.

The game would still operate the same. Just with a different skew than the prior ones. Before you build up your crew the game would still be similar to past fallout games but as you get stronger it would create a unique experience.

I believe this will be a cool idea for a game, it would have New-Vegas style writing with Fallout 4-esque gunplay. 

I would love for any improvements or ideas as i thought it was good but would love to improve it. :)",Fallout,Eggcellentboilol,False,/r/Fallout/comments/iyv708/i_had_a_concept_for_a_new_fallout_would_love/,1

793,"I just finished Nuka-World for the first time, and wanted to share my thoughts. (More of a rant, though)",1600885531," 

After avoiding it for many years, I finally started playing Fallout 4, and, surprisingly, it isn't as bad as I expected it to be (Granted, I installed a dialoge mod almost immediately, what were they even thinking?). However, I just finished (?) the Nuka World DLC, and I feel so disappointed that I came here to rant a bit.

In terms of worldbuilding, I loved it. The Theme Park theme is actually a great way to encapsule many distinct worlds in a single place, and most of them were really well done IMO. Likewise, the Raider factions were, at least aesthetically, very interesting. I especially enjoyed the Pack's colorful attires and masks. Even the premise of becoming a Raider was interesting.

The problem lies in actually having to play it. The first mission, with the gauntlet, was very interesting at first, but it gets very boring very quickly. It goes on forever with little to no variation. Turret-filled room followed by a bomb-filled room, followed by another turret-filled room and on and on. Then comes the mission of retaking the park. This was rather tedious as well, particularly Kiddie Kingdom and the World of Refreshment. One of my greatest annoyances with this game in general is that it appears to believe that challenge=an insane amount of enemies running relentlessly towards you, and those two worlds felt on par with that motif (The galactic-themed world had a bit of this going for it as well, but since I have the Robotics Expert perk I just hacked my way through it).

Then, after you have secured all the parks and gained favour with one or two factions and annoyed the rest (which is one of my favorite aspects of this DLC), you have to return to the Commonwealth and quite possibly sh\*t all over you progress with you settlements. Honestly, why would they do this? The DLC becomes available at level 30, at which point you will, most likely, have at least one or two settlements. In my case, when I got around to doing Nuka World, I had unlocked around 12 settlements and maxed a couple of them, so I wasn't eager on raiding them. I ended up choosing a settlement I hadn't yet unlocked and Preston, not only hated me, but became hostile, so I couldn't even go back to Sanctuary without him attacking me. And there's no way to progress on the DLC main questline without doing this, so I had to cut it short and kill everyone, which was very dissapointing.

One of my major grievances with the DLC's of FO4 is the presence of the Commonwealth. I still haven't finished Automatron because it's very underwhelming having to do everything in the Commonwealth. Nuka World takes it to another level, however, because in order to play it, not only do you have to go over and over to the Commonwealth, but you must roll over everything you have done so far. It's such a shame, as I feel like there was a lot of promise for this DLC in particular and was eager to play it. At least we still have Far Harbour

Despised the Brotherhood of Steel, always planned on betraying them but took full advantage of those Vertibird rides as I play survival.  Got into the Institute, met Father.

During this conversation I was actually moved to change my mind and support the Institute. So I head to Mass Fusion which instantly makes BoS hostile with me, no problem there as I always intended to betray them.    I head back to the Institute and thats where it starts to  hit me that maybe I made the wrong decision.  Father sends me to kill off the Railroad.

The problem with this is if I'm correct, even without the agenda deck depleting the game will end before the final quest is even started.

826,Why a Remake of Fallout: New Vegas would be better (right now) than Fallout: New Vegas 2,1600866800,"TLDR: Probably would take less time; hesitancy after the Outer Worlds; addition of cut features + bug fixes; revamping content; re-balancing; safer investment

The purchase of Bethesda by Microsoft has left many speculating about the future of the Fallout. Since it is unlikely, given the development of Starfield and TES6 and the reception to Fallout 76, that Bethesda will touch the IP within this decade, this leaves a dilemma for Xbox: they just spent all this money for these famous IPs, one of which being Fallout, but it is unlikely that any development by Bethesda for Fallout will occur in the near future, meaning Xbox would see a much lower return on investment. The obvious solution would be to have another studio (such as the studio responsible for making what fans consider the best game in the series, which they also own) to make it. This idea has also garnered popularity among the gaming community, since ""Fallout New Vegas 2"" has become a tagline for the acquisition. While I would love a New Vegas-esque game set somewhere else too (maybe somewhere like Washington that explores US-Canadian relations following the war), I actually believe that a remake of Fallout: New Vegas and potentially Fallouts 1 and 2 would be better than another spin-off, at least immediately following this acquisition.

Firstly, given that Obsidian is currently working on Avowed and an unknown project led by J.E. Sawyer, it is unlikely that they are going to be releasing a full-scale Fallout game in the near future, unless the latter is canned. Writing, scripting, recording, animating, and designing a whole new game would take much longer than simply up-scaling existing assets in New Vegas. By the time a brand-new game would come out, the hype from this deal being announced will likely have died down significantly, whereas a remake with an earlier release date would help get the franchise back in good graces and help prepare the way for future installments. 

Secondly, while I think the game is still better than Fallout 4, I agree with others that The Outer Worlds doesn't have nearly as much staying power as Fallout: New Vegas. That might be due to it being a AA game as opposed to a AAA one, meaning a lack of budget, or it could be because of design choices. In either case, it would be better if Obsidian were given the opportunity to reacquaint themselves with arguably their greatest game and understand why so many people love it before putting them to work on a ""sequel"" to it. It would be a shame if the reaction by Xbox to all of this hype would be to order a new Fallout game from Obsidian immediately and then have the game be called inferior to its predecessor by fans, much like The Outer Worlds was. Allowing Obsidian to remember what made New Vegas special through working on it again could help future projects both within and without the series.

Thirdly, we all know that many features that were originally going to be in the game were cut due to time constraints. This acquisition represents the perfect opportunity to restore some of those features.  The Legion was severely underdeveloped because of time constraints, as we all know, and I would love to see wwhat was originally planned for them. One minor one that sticks out to me is the Super Mutant Ranger at the NCR camp near Jacobstown. Another could be having an actual flight-simulator that can be accessed after being idolized by the Boomers.  This could also allow them to fix certain bugs or otherwise annoying flaws, such as the fact that companions will drink rare consumables like Nuka Cola Victory that you put on your shelf (I killed Boone over this after he did while looking at me).

Fourthly, this could allow certain quests to be revamped. If I had to have one faction and their related quests revamped, it would be the Brotherhood of Steel. It always bothered me that no matter what they almost always remained isolationist, that it made little difference if you had McNamara deposed, or that you always had to kill them if you sided with House. If I could change it, I would have it that if you gather all of the technologies from Veronica's quest, you keep McNamara in charge, and you have a high enough Speech (or Charisma, but that I'll get to in a bit), you can convince McNamara to have the BoS take a more active part in the wasteland. This way, for those (like myself) that are willing to go out of their way for them, they can see a prosperous future for the Brotherhood. And for the House part, after stating that you had managed to convince the Brotherhood to abandon their isolationist policy, maybe he could be persuaded to allow the Brotherhood to live under his authority. House could agree to give them all of the NCR's technology and allow them to occupy Camp McCarran if they served as a police force along distant trade routes that he would rather not send his Securitrons (I'm just spit-balling ideas, but you get my point). Another would be being able to tell Christine and Veronica that you had met the other (since all the DLC would almost assuredly be included in the remaster), since it always seemed odd that Elijah left a message for Veronica but not Christine. Maybe giving Veronica the letter from Christine would lead to a new ending where she goes to the Sierra Madre to find her. Do you guys get what I'm getting at? A remaster could allow this game to become perfect.

Fifthly, the game could use some re-balancing. Specifically, the Charisma stat. That thing is useless, and we all know it. If I had to think of a way to make it useful, I would have Charisma tie into your ability to deal with factions. As stated previously, maybe the only way to convince McNamara to engage with the Mojave Wasteland would be with a high Charisma check. The same could be done for convincing Mr. House, Colonel Moore, or the Legion that the Brotherhood can be allied with. Also, maybe having a high Charisma would allow you to speak to members of a Vilified faction without them sniffing you out. Lastly, having a high or low Charisma would influence how much reputation is gained or lost, with high Charisma yielding higher rep gained and lower lost while low Charisma would mean gaining faction rep is harder but losing it is easier. On a somewhat related note, Terrifying Presence should not be unlocked based on how high your Speech is, but instead how high your Strength is, since by the time you have a Speech stat high enough the perk is nearly useless. This would give builds with a strong-silent type vibe to talk their way out of scenarios without forcing them to dump points into Speech. Lastly, while part of me believes that max Luck makes getting money way too easy, another part of me really enjoys it and believes it adds to the role-playing aspect. But the Sierra Madre gold-bar glitch where you drag Elijahs body to the side of the barrier and then run to the other side to loot his body before leaving would more than likely be patched.  

Lastly, this is probably the most significant reason for why a remaster of New Vegas would be better than a sequel: money. Here's another word for ya: nostalgia. That one word has become the marketing strategy for nearly every entertainment business these days, and now late 2000s early 2010s nostalgia is starting to kick in. What better time than now to repackage a cult classic? Plus, it would probably take a much smaller investment of time and resources to remaster New Vegas than to make a whole new game, since you can pull the voice files, quests, design, etc. from the original game. For a lot less they'd make a lot more. 

While this post is mainly about Fallout: New Vegas, I would also like to briefly explore the potential for Fallouts 1 and 2. I think the original games should definitely be ported to mobile, since the isometric style of the games and simple combat would be perfect for it. As for remakes, I myself would prefer 3D versions that pull the audio for certain characters like the Master from the original game, but I can see a case for having InXile be put in charge of remaking them while maintaining the isometric style. I'd be fine with either one as long as they were available on console. 

So, there you have it. This is why I believe a remaster of New Vegas would be better to have first than a direct sequel. This is my first Reddit post, so let me know if I did well.",Fallout,Ghosto_Rosso,False,/r/Fallout/comments/iy9u8k/why_a_remake_of_fallout_new_vegas_would_be_better/,1

After all, we know for a fact that the Enclave has at the very least 1 known presence in Chicago and could very well have far more strongholds and bases somewhere within the vast expanse that is the still-relatively unexplored Post-War America.

I remember when they were about to announce Fallout 76, (when we already had a name) my brain rushed with several ideas of what it could be.

A game designed completely in that world, maybe a 2D platformer  like Cuphead or a 2D open world like Stardew Valley, and given the graphics this could come to the switch. 

I guess my point is that while I like the RPGs, they could do a lot more. And now they have resources and other studios that can help. So I’d love to get something different while we wait for fallout 5.

I could have a crack at some ideas but I've only fully played Fallout 4 so not really familiar with vaults from other games, so maybe some of my ideas have all ready been done.

- Vault 69 .. okay this just came into my head. I thought to myself what if the number of the vault wasn't just random for one vault, where the number is actually thematically related to the experiments of the vault. Enter Vault 69 - the vault where inhabitants are experimented on in some kind of sexual way.. or something. ..I dunno'..

- Ooh.. okay this is kinda' trippy and possibly a lame idea.. but, maybe a vault whose objective is to establish evidence of an afterlife and more to the point, to make contact with those in the afterlife. So the inhabitants are trained and conditioned to be highly conscious of the afterlife, maybe they are Flatliners like in the Kevin Bacon film, where they are repeatedly intentionally flatlined so that they can report on their experiences while clinically dead.. and so anyway when the inhabitants die for the final time, they go into death knowing that their mission is to make contact with and communicate with those who are still living.. and so it's all about developing some kinda' technology or something which allows the living to actually communicate with the dead.

- Maybe something Big Brotheresque, where there are the contestants.. who live in a luxury Big Brother house like pad within the vault, but similar to that ridiculous show they need permission to do pretty much everything, can never leave the pad, they have to do challenges for food etc. ..and then the viewers/voters. Maybe they're a council of overseers rather than just one overseer.. or maybe they're just the scientists similar to that one under Malden school. And these guys watch the contestants lives sort of like reality tv.. and of course they vote contestants out, and each time a contestant is voted out they're just booted out into the real world, completely out of the vault. Thrown to the wolv.. deathclaws. So the contestants literally think their luxury pad is their world because it's all they've ever known, and to them the overseer(s) is/are god. They hear the voice but never see them. And when they are voted out.. I dunno' maybe they're lied to that they're going somewhere better.. and then they just get booted out into a world they never knew existed.

I dunno' I'm just spitballin' here..",Fallout,Electric_Logan,False,/r/Fallout/comments/ixvx5h/ideas_for_vaults/,1
885,Why an Obsidian-made Fallout spinoff is now likely,1600805852,"So to open up I'm going to begin with the fact that yes, the Xbox merger is what made this a possibility, but it's not the key reason that it is likely. The big reason that an Obsidian spinoff is likely is because of the same factor that made New Vegas possible: Bethesda's busy schedule. As we all know the reason Obsidian got the chance to make a Fallout was because of Bethesda working on both an Elder Scrolls title AND a new engine, both of which are circumstances that are being repeated in this very moment with the production of Starfield/TES6 and their respective new engine. While Fallout 76 could potentially serve as the intermediary in the meantime, it is still unlikely that Microsoft would want one of their most profitable IP's to go without a new release for nearly a decade, especially when a new console generation is about to start right now. Obsidian is currently working on Avowed, Grounded and Outer Worlds DLC, but from current understanding only Avowed reaches any size scope near the next two BGS titles, and they're not making a new engine to do so. On top of this Microsoft is well aware of the attention that New Vegas receives compared to its counterparts, and would absolutely capitalize on that to bring users to either a console exclusive and/or new title for game pass. My guess would be that this potential spinoff would likely not be a New Vegas 2, but something more akin to a ""Fallout San Francisco"", an area very heavily teased in fallout 4 (unless said location is being used for Fallout 5, which is actually fairly likely due to aforementioned teases). Overall though I would say that the likelihood of collaboration between Bethesda and Obsidian has increased significantly, although hopefully there is still some friendly competition between the two.",Fallout,Man_The_Bat_Jew,False,/r/Fallout/comments/ixvdjp/why_an_obsidianmade_fallout_spinoff_is_now_likely/,1
886,Do you think there is a chance that Microsoft would fast track a new Fallout game?,1600805462,"I don't know about you all but, personally, I'm not a fan of having to wait 7 to 10 years for a new single player Fallout game. 

I am kind of hoping that the recent acquisition could change that original timeline for three main reasons:

1. With the financial success of the latest single player Fallout games, it seems like waiting that long to capitalize on that franchise is a waste of time. (Unless they are completely satisfied with revenues generated by 76)
2. After investing so much money, it stands to reason that Microsoft could want to accelerate their return on investment. (granted they will probably get a big roi with new subscriptions on game pass and it may help them in the next gen console war, but still, they could probably make more than half a billion with a new single player Fallout game). 
3. Since they now employ almost everyone who ever had a hand in making the Fallout franchise so successful, they definitely have the talent and the manpower at their disposal.

come to think of it i want to see alaska. native americans thriving there and in the yukon? elaborate battlefield exploration? main story can revolve around the enclave trying to retake all the US Army supplies plus a metal gear like liberty prime if they need a new setpiece. show us chinese communities made from the soldiers who were stranded. let us go to the bering strait and get tantalizingly close to asia. maybe the chinese villages are trying to power up an old ship or build a bridge because they want to go home. maybe the enclave commander is actually a chinese villager who hated that nobody else appreciated where they lived now, so he rised the ranks of the enclave and is planning a march on the chinese with the metal gear they found. maybe there's an American R&amp;D center in anchorage where you can pick up powerful experimental weapons with interesting limitations. maybe there are more ghouls in alaska than in other parts of the world because that was a prime target for nukes. maybe there is word of a strange republic based out of california that is currently making moves in vancouver and is moving northward fast. maybe you can use the enclave technology to prevent the NCR's advance. maybe you can radicalize the chinese villagers and take their ship and use it to pillage the west coast. maybe there's a dlc where there is a british commonwealth monarchy in BC or alberta or someplace, and they are fighting with the NCR. a dlc where you accidentally reactivate a dormant american military AI and it has an army or powerarmor infantry that you will have to trounce before they make their way out of the area.

So I’d like to discuss possible motivations that could have been used instead, whether it be a head-canon, a goofy idea, or whatever else you think might be better.

My own idea is that it’s a method of control. Even the greatest empire eventually falls, usually due to internal forces.

901,"Fallout New Vegas, where are they now? A look into who is left from the original New Vegas dev team at Obsidian",1600797093,"Hey guys! Since I know we are all excited about the fact that the chance of a ""Fallout New Vegas 2"" isn't 0% anymore, I figured I would talk about who on the original New Vegas team is still around at Obsidian. I think many people don't realize that Obsidian is not just one dev team, it is actually split up into 3 to 4 separate teams depending on how many games Obsidian has in production. For example right now Obsidian has 4 teams in no particular order: Team 1 is working on Avowed, Team 2 is working on Grounded, Team 3 recently released The Outer Worlds and is currently working on it's DLC, and Team 4, headed up by Josh Sawyer, is currently working on an unannounced project that has been in development since the release of Pillars of Eternity 2 back in mid 2018.

Below I'll be going over the Lead developers and writers who worked on New Vegas, as well as what they have been working on since, and whether or not they are still at Obsidian. The titles next to their name correspond to the role they played in developing New Vegas.

Josh Sawyer: Project Director, Lead Designer, and System Designer (Still there)

* Prior to New Vegas, Josh would be most well known for being a designer on Icewind Dale, and the Lead Designer on Icewind Dale II and Neverwinter Nights 2. Since New Vegas, he has directed both Pillars of Eternity 1 &amp; 2, and is currently working on an unannounced title at Obsidian. [He did not work on Outer Worlds other than providing feedback occasionally due to his role as the Studio Design Director for Obsidian.]( John Gonzalez: Creative Design Lead, Lead Writer (No longer there)

* Prior to New Vegas, John would be most well known for his role as the Lead Narrative Designer of Tom Clancy’s EndWar over at Ubisoft, before joining Obsidian to work on New Vegas as the Lead Writer. Following New Vegas, John left the company sometime after all of the New Vegas DLC was finished in order to go work at Guerrilla Games as the Lead Writer for Horizon Zero Dawn. He recently left Guerrilla in order to work at a new studio called Smilegate Barcelona, a spinoff of the South Korean developer Smilegate, in order to work on an unannounced AAA open-world game.

Chris Avellone: Writer (No longer there)

* Prior to New Vegas, Chris would be most well known as the Lead Writer and Designer for Planescape: Torment and Kotor 2, as well as a designer for Fallout 2 and Icewind Dale 1 &amp; 2. He was also the Lead Designer for the cancelled “Van Buren” also known as “Fallout 3” over at Interplay before their closure and sale of the IP to Bethesda. Following New Vegas, Chris would work as a writer for Pillars of Eternity and Tyranny before leaving Obsidian in 2015 to work as a freelance writer. As a freelance he would write for Torment: Tides of Numenera, Prey, Divinity: Original Sin II, Pathfinder Kingmaker, and Jedi: Fallen Order.

Eric Fenstermaker: Writer, Area Designer (Still there)

* Prior to New Vegas, Erik was a writer for Neverwinter Nights 2. Following the release of New Vegas, as well as the departure of current Lead Writer “John Gonzalez”, Erik would serve as the Lead Writer for South Park: The Stick of Truth, as well as the Lead Narrative Designer on Pillars of Eternity 1 &amp; 2. He did not work on The Outer Worlds and is seemingly working on either Avowed, or the aforementioned unannounced game along with Josh Sawyer, most likely as its Lead Narrative Designer.

Travis Stout: Writer, Area Designer (No longer there)

* Prior to New Vegas, Travis’s only credit is as an additional designer for Neverwinter Nights 2. Following New Vegas, he began work as an area designer for South Park: The Stick of Truth, but left during development to work on State of Decay as a designer. Since then Travis went to Ubisoft where he worked as a writer on Assassin’s Creed Unity &amp; Syndicate, and For Honor.

Joe Sanabria: Lead Artist (No longer there)

* Following New Vegas, Joe was laid off from Obsidian in 2011 and currently works as a freelance artist as well as an adjunct professor over at Laguna College of Art and Design.

Scott Everts: World Building Lead (Still there)

* A Technical/Level Designer on Fallout 1 &amp; 2, Planescape: Torment, and Icewind Dale 1 &amp; 2, Scott would leave the defunct Interplay Entertainment in 2004 to join the newly formed Obsidian Entertainment. Here he would be a designer on Kotor 2 and Neverwinter Nights 2, before becoming the World Building Lead on Fallout New Vegas. Following New Vegas, his name does not pop up again until the release of The Outer Worlds, where he was one of 10 different Environment Artists that worked on the game. I’m not sure if he was demoted, or what he was doing in the interim between the two games but if anyone does know, please let me know as I was unable to find more info.

Mark Bremerkamp: Lead Animator (No longer there)

* Prior to New Vegas, Mark would be most well known for being the Lead Animator on the cult classic Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. At Obsidian he would work as the Lead Animator on Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol, and Pillars of Eternity. During production of Pillars, Mark left Obsidian and moved to Michigan in order to be closer to his family.

Charlie Staples: Area Design Lead, Lead Level Designer (Still there)

* After New Vegas, Charlie would act as the Level Design Lead on South Park: The Stick of Truth, the Systems Designer on the cancelled Armored Warfare, and the Design Director on The Outer Worlds.

Frank Kowalkowski: Lead Programmer (No longer there)

* Prior to New Vegas, Frank was a programmer on Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance II, and Kotor 2. And was the Lead Programmer on Neverwinter Nights 2. Following the release of New Vegas, Frank joined Blizzard as a programmer for World of Warcraft and has since been promoted to Technical Director as of the latest expansion pack, World of Warcraft: Shadowlands.

Now obviously this list is a mere fraction of the 100+ people who worked on the game, but I felt that focusing on the Lead roles (since they had the largest impact on the game), as well as the writers (Since New Vegas's script is so beloved) would be the best way to display the information without going overboard and listing dozens upon dozens of people. It was surprising for me to find out how few people from the New Vegas team actually worked on The Outer Worlds. That's likely why The Outer Worlds was so different from New Vegas, which is what many people expected it to play similar too. I think anyone worried however after reading this that Obsidian no longer has the talent they once had needn't worry since Obsidian has hired many new talented devs since, and also Josh Sawyer is still at the company and he played the largest role in the development of the game by far.

912,I don’t want a New Vegas 2. I want a *new* New Vegas,1600751621,"I know I’m in good company when I say *Fallout: New Vegas* is one of the greatest games of all time. It’s quest and story structure, it’s capacity for *choice*, it’s next level writing and characters, all come together to make a gem out of a ramshackle bucket of bolts that barely held together. Obsidian’s tweet today has literally been the best news of 2020 for me. I cannot wait to see what the writers at obsidian can do with next gen bethesda world building. 

But just because I love that tweet doesn’t mean I love the idea of new Vegas 2 as such. None of the fallout games, even as they’ve occasionally returned to places from previous games (I honestly haven’t played 1 or 2 so this is from my memory of story summaries), just made a new game in exactly the same area as the previous game. New Vegas made mention of plenty of fallout 1 and 2 areas, but it made something new too. I want something new again. 

I honestly don’t want to find out what exactly happened after the Courier walked his long road, I don’t want to know if House is building to go to the moon or the NCR has annexed it or we’re hailing Caesar or if it’s a zombie sex fueled anarchist paradise. Let new Vegas have the future the courier created, and give us a new world to make or unmake.

However, that doesn’t mean just have obsidian make another fallout game in a random place and basically continue the numbered line in lieu of Bethesda. I think one of the great things Obsidian was able to do was go back to the rich history and lore interplay had previously developed on the west coast. I want to continue that path, but this game should be so much more than the Nevada desert. There’s a reason so many films are in California, and it’s because it has the greatest breadth and diversity of environments anywhere in North America. From beaches to mountains, grasslands to desert, cities to villages, let’s see fallout new Hollywood, or Francisco, or Angeles hell head north up the west coast and show us some Canadians in new Portland or Seattle (the latter may be particularly welcomed by their new overlords). 

Anyhoo, that’s my rant.

915,I don't get some of the hate on Fallout 4,1600748812,"I know Bethesda in general gets flack for their games, but Fallout 4 lately has been getting shit on a lot, and I think at least some of it in unjustified.

The character building in 4 is pretty good. I'm pretty sure at this point most of the community agrees that skills had to go. Skills are really bad for character building, they punish specialized builds way too much and made special stats way less valuable. Replacing skills with perks also wasn't bad. If you complain about the basic perks that are just damage increases, you probably didn't play Fallout 1 and 2 where the only usable perks were straight stat increases. Even ignoring that, perks like idiot savant, rooted, and ghoulish feel like classic Fallout perks. Special stats are also way more valuable now, making the initial stat selection and leveling more important. The only issue I have with the perk system is there are some perks that are just not worth taking. Not because they're bad by themselves, but because there are other perks with way more value. For traits being gone, that can easily be explained by the whole game being geared toward long term play, and imagine dealing with a sizeable downside for an entire playthrough.

I understand the complaints on the dialogue, but I think it's still bashed too much. For the dialogue diamond/wheel, I understand it looks bad, but mechanically it's a good system. You constantly have choices to be an asshole, a smart ass, or be nice at any given time. Compare this to Fallout 1, 2, and New vegas where you can be kinda nice, or an asshole, and usually those are your only options. Or in 3 where your options were either sucking the NPC's dick or telling them to suck yours. As good as this system is I will admit it looks bad and I don't want to see it in Fallout 5, though I do want the variety of dialogue options. I have similar thoughts on the voiced protagonist. I understand this is pretty bad to have in a Fallout game, but I grew to be fine with it, and I think that sentiment has grown on most of the community, as i rarely see complaints on the protagonist being voiced anymore. Like the dialogue wheel even if I'm fine with this I don't want to see it done again. For actual written dialogue I also understand the complaints, but I see people compare final boss speeches to random mid-questline NPCs. I like to excuse the quirky mind changes NPCs make when gone through a charisma check a consequence of when you have to make charisma viable enough for players to want to build into. Conversations now feel very human, and they've gotten pretty good at this over time, as seen in 76. 

I don't see myself as someone able to accurately judge writing, but I have noticed people aimlessly bash Bethesda. Now I will admit, the institute is probably the worst written antagonist out of any Fallout game and some Elder Scrolls games where the villains are written just to be motiveless bad guys. Even then, I think their motives and lore are somewhat interesting, they're very similar to House from New Vegas if he was a council instead of one dude. People say Fallout 4 has no moral greyness, but just look at synths. Through the whole game and especially in Far Harbor, you're conflicted with whether synths are humans, abominations, or machines. The faction conflict is also in full force in 4. A very popular complaint is that choices have no consequence, which, is probably the complaint I understand the least of. You have four endings, with lasting impacts and consequence throughout the game. The consequences are so big most people side with the minutemen since their ending has half as much consequence s the other three. These endings are as impactful as New Vegas except here you can easily see your consequence in the world after it's done. You also have a DLC who's sole purpose is to allow you to say fuck the only neutral faction for the ability to be a raider. 

After writing this I realized I said I don't agree with some criticism when I just listed off every complaint I've heard, but I wanted to share my realization I had after replaying 4 after a long time of not touching the game.

919,What is the Ratslayer and Longhammer of the other Bethesda games?,1600746158,"I recently started a Fallout NV VH HC run and read a old reddit post where a guy said every time he started one he made a dash for the Broc Flower Cave to pick up the gun. Since he said he did it at level 1 I thought it’d be easy enough..

Holy shit Giant Rats! The first part of the cave was easy enough but the second I got to the upper level where Ratslayer is I aggro’d 2 rats and by the time I got the gun there’d be another 10 charging up my exit route to block my escape. After dying ~10 times I realized two things 1) this isn’t working and I have to think of a new approach, and 2) this reminds me a whole hell of a lot of the Longhammer Cave in Skyrim (which I made another level 1 attempt at 2 years ago). About half an hour later after picking up Boone and EDE I finally chopped through the horde of Giant Rats, kept both companions alive and got out of the cave, but it inspired me to wonder - 

Do the other Fallout/Elder Scrolls games have these style caves where you can get a super strong weapon early on if you can figure out a way past the insanely hard enemies?

I don’t think Fallout 4 has one? The Overseerers Guardian maybe? But that doesn’t have a challenge behind it - just get 3000 caps and go to the location.

-The map would be anchored by Vancouver on one end and Seattle on the other. 

-Could do crazy things with coastal/elevation changes from seismic activity. Maybe turn it into a mountainous archipelago.

-Could have the NCR and other west coast factions pushing up from the south. You could also have a faction descended from Chinese soldiers that had to fight their way south from Alaska after the bombs dropped and they lost their supply lines/couldn't withdraw in the aftermath of Operation Anchorage.

**Fallout Quebec**:

-Anchored by Montreal and Quebec City. Stretch the map to Ottawa/Eastern Ontario if you're feeling ambitious (you could put a vault in the Diefenbunker!)

-Major factions could be descended from the US military occupation,  Canadian government remnant, and Quebec separatists (their stronghold could be within the ramparts of Old Quebec). East coast factions from prev games are pushing up the interstate network and could have a foothold in Sherbrooke.

-Central conflict would be control of trade along Trans-Canada Highway/St. Lawrence River and/or economic hub of Montreal.

-National parks in the NW of the map could be overrun with high level monsters (polar yao guai anyone?)

-Quebec was among the earliest areas of North America to be colonized by European powers. Maybe the port in Quebec City has had strange visitors from far away?

-Obligatory unique power fist named the Shawinigan Handshake.

**Fallout Toronto**:

-We already know ""Ronto"" is a canon location.

-Map is the centered in the middle of our universe (according to people who live there now). Stretches across Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, possibly north towards Lake Simcoe/Georgian Bay.

-Can include all the major Toronto landmarks, could do wacky things like have an expy of the Leafs in an eternal battle to win the Stanley Cup from the only other hockey team to survive the nukes. Maybe they've devolved into warrior clans, and compete for the cup in ritual combat.

-Another fun idea would be to have the CN Tower crumble and fall on the Skydome or something.

-Another good option for Bethesda to continue the storyline of the East coast factions, who would be expanding west/northwest in this case.

**Fallout Niagara**:

-Similar option to Fallout Toronto for including the east coast factions.

-map is bisected by the Niagara river, centered on Niagara Falls.

-Buffalo can be a major city or a ruined urban wasteland. Take your pick. I would use St. Catharines and Welland as the western border of the map. You could probably push to Hamilton, but at the point you may as well do Fallout Toronto instead.

-Maybe the vineyards of Niagara-on-the-lake are now unnaturally fertile farmland. Maybe they're growing something WEIRD.

-You could have a conflict over the hydroelectricity from the falls, although this may be too similar to New Vegas. 

-Alternatively, the main conflict could revolve around Buffalo and St Catharines to control access to Lake Erie and Lake Ontario respectively, as well as fighting over the Niagara River to control transit between them. 

-Another potential focus on the river could be Canadian remnants who are none too pleased with the established east coast factions trying to push across into their turf (you could flip also flip this the other way and have the Canadians be the aggressors). This, again, may be to similar to New Vegas (NCR trying to hold the Legion along the Colorado River), but people have been competing over strategic rivers since quite literally the dawn of civilization (look up the etymology of Mesopotamia) so I'm willing to let it slide.

944,Why the NCR will be the Most Likely Canonical Victor of the Second Battle of Hoover Dam.,1600736750,"Given the recent news that Microsoft has acquired Zenimax in addition to the fact that a direct sequel to Fallout: New Vegas could very well be in the works, I've been inspired to make a post detailing my thoughts as to why the NCR ending of F:NV will most certainly be the canon ending of the game. Let's start from the top, shall we?

1. The NCR are irrevocably the heroes of the story.

Love them or hate them, the NCR, despite its numerous problems and burdens, are the obvious good guys of the game. This stands in direct contrast to the Legion (who, despite their upsides, are the clear-cut villains of the story regardless of how you try to spin it), Mr. House (who's more of a neutrally-aligned character, if anything (though, in my opinion, he's every bit as evil, petty and vindictive as Caesar himself)) and Yes Man (who's honestly only just there to ensure that the player can finish the game). 

None of whom are even remotely close to ""good"", at the end of the day. And given that the good guys have ALWAYS emerged victorious in EVERY canon Fallout game regardless of whether or not it came from Interplay or Bethesda, it's more than safe to assume that the NCR (which has yet to be given the shaft by any Fallout game, so far) has the canon ending.

2. The NCR ending is without a single doubt the best ending in the game.

While I honestly believe that even those who either don't like the NCR or just flat-out hate the NCR are forced to admit it regardless of whether they like it or not, the NCR ending is easily the best ending of the game from a purely objective point of view. Not only is it the only ending in the game where EVERYBODY benefits and even flat-out prospers (though, admittedly, it's not all cupcakes and rainbows as the citizens of Goodsprings and Primm can attest to), it's also the only ending where EVERYBODY can survive (provided that one's willing to work for it, of course), as well. 

Indeed, even the best Legion ending still sees a huge portion of the local population enslaved or murdered under Caesar's brutal rule, almost every other faction killed off or enslaved and what essentially amounts to a genocidal, mass-murdering, slaving, massively savage totalitarian utilitarian military dictatorship taking over the region, for instance. Meanwhile, even the best House ending still sees Mr. House effectively abandoning everything and everyone outside of the New Vegas Strip and leaving them to fend for themselves whereas a shitload of innocent people still get killed due to his negligence. 

As for an Independent Vegas, even the best Yes Man ending (which, admittedly, is easily the second best ending in the game) still sees New Vegas devolve into a completely anarchic, Hellish shithole that becomes completely overwhelmed with skyrocketing crime, massive drug abuse, chronic shortages of even the most basic of necessities and utilities and a total collapse of any semblance of law and order all while the Courier gets rich off of the New Vegas Strip's gambling and resort operations. Either way, the NCR ending is clearly the best ending possible.

And as all canon Fallout endings have ALWAYS been the absolute best ending possible, this further reinforces the notion of the NCR canonically winning the Second Battle of Hoover Dam.

3. The NCR always wins.

If there's one thing that we can all agree on in regards to the NCR, it's that it ALWAYS seems to win. It won in Fallout 1 when it was founded and very quickly expanded across all of southern California and it won in Fallout 2 when it eventually gobbled up the rest of California and expanded both its territory and influence across all of Oregon, all of the Baja Peninsula, all of Nevada and even as far East as Utah and Arizona (most particularly in Bullhead City and all of its immediate surrounding areas) by the events of F:NV. Something tells me that the NCR is about ready for a third victory in F:NV.

4. Chris Avellone is gone.

With that prick Avellone gone, any and all remaining anti-civilization nonsense within Obsidian is also gone, as well. Meaning that there won't be any second Apocalypse from the Sierra Madre, Tunnelers, the nukes of the Divide or any other stupid bullshit that Avellone dreamed up. Furthermore, an Independent Vegas just seems incredibly unlikely now that Obsidian is back on track and actively in full support of the eventual full return of civilization to the Wastelands. Something that an Independent Vegas ending would completely contradict. Meaning that a canon NCR ending is quite frankly the only logical choice.

5. The NCR is by far the most popular out of 4 main factions.

In every opinion poll that I've ever seen, the NCR ALWAYS either has a commanding lead, a general lead or is tied with an Independent Vegas. The Legion, on the other hand, is always dead-last and often doesn't even get so much as a SINGLE vote (for obvious reasons, of course), Mr. House is either 3rd place with only a few votes or tied for dead last with the Legion (often due to the fact that 1. he's entirely dependent on the player to get anything done, 2. really doesn't do anything in his incredibly boring ending and 3. we're left without even the slightest clue as to whether or not he intends to follow through with his grandiose promises, which is VERY anti-climactic) and an Independent Vegas is always either neck-to-neck with the NCR, barely behind the NCR or just second place (everybody is quite frankly thrilled with the often false notion that they can ""rule"" New Vegas as their own, after all).

Given the NCR's popularity, which is the direct result of the NCR being the good guys who at the very least TRY to help everyone and actually do a far better job than they're often given credit for not to mention the above fact that their ending is objectively the best ending possible, it's very safe to say that they'll most definitely have the canon ending.

6. The NCR ending is by far the most flexible ending.

The NCR ending is really the only ending that leaves room for a sequel and paves the way for a logical, realistic route towards continuing the Fallout saga in the American Southwest. The Legion ending doesn't make any sense at all as we all know for a fact that 1. the Legion will inevitably collapse once Caesar dies and effectively cease to exist as an entity, 2. we already know that the Legion doesn't stand a snowball's chance in Hell against the NCR in a total war (meaning that even if the Legion wins the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, they could NEVER win the war against the NCR, which will eventually wipe them out) and 3. the Legion would have a hard-enough time just holding and defending NEW VEGAS ALONE as it is and would eventually destroy itself just TRYING to do so, all but ensuring that a direct sequel to F:NV wouldn't be practical with a canonical Legion victory at Hoover Dam.

The House ending doesn't really work either in that it's extremely boring, highly anti-climactic, completely uneventful and ultimately doesn't leave any room for a sequel. Nothing really happens and everything just more or less stays the same albeit with several minor changes. Something that makes a canonical House ending impossible as a sequel based on that just wouldn't work. In regards to the Independent Vegas ending, while it is far from inflexible (unlike the Legion and House endings) and is actually a very interesting ending (I personally wouldn't mind an Independent Vegas ending myself), I really have a hard time seeing a direct sequel to F:NV emerge from an Independent Vegas ending.

Not only does it directly contradict the pro-civilization aims of Obsidian, but it also just comes off as more of a fail-safe to ensure that the player can finish the game in the event that they both piss off the NCR and the Legion and kill Mr. House, if you ask me. The fact that Yes Man is completely unkillable and the fact that the player can still pursue an Independent Vegas even if they've blown up the Securitron Army over at Fortification Hill (making an Independent Vegas completely pointless, but I digress) definitely helps to support that notion. Either way, the NCR ending is the only feasible ending that would make a direct sequel to F:NV possible.

And that's a wrap. Now before I conclude my post, I'd like to point out that this is pure speculation and could very well be completely incorrect in the grand scheme of things.

965,The future of Fallout (and other Bethesda titles),1600726416,With the purchase of Zenimax and thus Bethesda by Microsoft a lot of people are already speculating that Fallout 5 (or whatever the name will be) and other games will become Xbox exclusives. Now I this is my opinion and what I’d consider good business practices but I’m not Todd Howard or Microsoft so don’t take my word as gospel. I would imagine that they won’t be. New IPs like Starfield and Deathloop it’s possible. But Fallout and Elder Scrolls (and by extension Doom) are to large to pass up releases on PlayStation and PC especially with the modding community being what it is.

981,[Mods] [FNV: TTW] High DAM weapons in the Capital Wasteland?,1600720064,"So for the most part I'm really digging a Tale of Two Wastelands, which starts you off in the Capital Wasteland and later gives you the option of traveling to the Mojave. 

Problem is, TTW makes several modifications to the Capital Wasteland's opponents and game mechanics that the original didn't do; namely, enemies now have the DT stat, instead of just having Damage Resistance, and as such absorb a lot of damage.

The result? Killing Enclave members and other high-dam enemies is nigh impossible; FO3 didn't have the plethora of semi-auto and lever-action guns that F:NV did. Besides the sniper rifle and Lincoln's Repeater- both of which have ammo that is pretty uncommon- most guns (including the 10mm Lever Action Rifle), and even most energy weapons (besides Harkness's plasma rifle and the Tesla Cannon- even then, there's only so many Microfusion Cells), don't cut it. Hunting rifles and Ol' Painless now also use .308 ammo, which is rather hard to come by.

Given how many there are, I'm basically reduced to punching or slashing Enclave and Super Mutants to death after only a few encounters, or having Fawkes or Star Paladin Cross to do it for me. While initially enjoyable, it gets tiresome rather quickly, not to mention unsuitable for anything besides close quarters indoors.

I don't know if there's anybody else who's tried this mod that has managed to find a workaround and a winning combo of weapons, or if there's a mod that introduces some of New Vegas's weapons to the Capital Wasteland.

So what they do, is teleport small groups of low tier synths outside of target areas and let them attack from there. It's incredibly dumb. If they want Elder Maxson dead, they could do it instantly if they wanted to. They know exactly where he is, why not teleport 3 coursers into his office, or a tier 1 synth with a bomb into the Prydwyn's engine room, or even better, teleport a low gen synth INSIDE of Maxson. It makes no sense, they can kill anyone at any time, but they just send in shitty foot soldiers in groups of 3. Want to kill Liberty Prime? Teleport a synth inside of it's head. Want to kill the railroad? Teleport a synth inside every member at once. Oh, they don't know where it is? Have a gen 3 synth kill kellogg, then let the railroad reach out to them, not knowing that they're a sleeper agent, find their hideout, and teleport 100 synths with bombs strapped to them inside of the church basement.

1031,Would like some help on a project of mine: porting the Classic games to a TTRPG module,1600705158,"*^(I guess the Announcement flair works?)*

Lemme  get right to the point: I want to run Fallout 1 and 2 as a TTRPG for my  friends. I'm currently in the process of reviewing the rules system and  making a character creation document. However, the actual games are a  slightly different matter. While the Wiki has been an invaluable tool,  it doesn't have all the information I need regarding dialogue, enemies,  skill check difficulties, and so on. I myself can't possibly test  everything myself, so I could use the help of strangers on the internet.

If you want to help, DM me. If people seem interested, I'll make a Discord server and google project or whatever.

I  don't plan on this being a massive thing with a Kickstarter and prizes  and preorders and balloons. I just want to get the data and then publish  it for free online, starting with 1 and then moving on to 2.

Here's What I Need:

***General Info:***

* Dialogue Trees for each NPC and especially talking heads
* Enemy/NPC numbers for each area
* Loot and vendor inventories for each area

***Specialized Skills:***

* I would like someone proficient in HTML and CSS to make digital character sheets for Roll20 so that folks can play online.
* Someone  with the programs needed to open the game data and extract the maps and  other data, which could decrease the labor intensity of gathering the  general info
* Someone  with at least passing knowledge of RPG design who could help with  bringing some more Computer Gamey-ey element to a tabletop system, and  balancing the rewards and challenges around several party members

Just  DM me if you would like to help. I'll figure something out for allowing  lots of people to help on one project. Suggestions welcome!",Fallout,Solarat1701,False,/r/Fallout/comments/ix3k69/would_like_some_help_on_a_project_of_mine_porting/,1

\- Bethesda is quite a small studio (for example - there are currently about 800 in-house developers working on Cyberpunk 2077);

\- Bethesda has already revealed its plans for the coming years and there is no FO5 in them;

\- Bethesda still sticks to its old engine, which is not an attractive solution on new platforms

\- Bethesda has strongly damaged the fans' belief that they know how to do good Fallout (FO4 and FO76 reviews).

Isn't it a good opportunity for MS to restart the series under a new banner (maybe Obsidian, but is it necessary?) using cutting edge technology (UE5?), without the weight of the old engine?

1172,Deacon from Fallout 4's dialogue boils down the theme of the Fallout franchise while also offering some of the most sound advice for people both in-game and in the real world.,1600629795,"Especially in the times we live, I was surprised that after having reached affinity levels with Deacon, he suddenly hits you with the typical spcheel about how the Railroad is amazing and the best hope for the world and everyone else is evil etc etc... Of course, you call him out on this, and he admits that it's all bullshit for the most part. Then he hits you with;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;... And, there's a point to this - a lesson, if you will.  There're other organizations out there. And, in time, I'm sure they're going to spoon-feed you their own patented form of bullshit.    
&gt;  
&gt;Ignore the verbage and look at what they're doing. What they're asking you to do.  What sort of world they'd have you build and how they're going to pay for it ...  
&gt;  
&gt;...  And at the end of the day you'll need to make a choice. Make it the right one.

I think this accurately summarizes the major themes of almost all the factions and protagonists of pretty much every Fallout game that has you choosing between a faction to rule certain locations. 

A heavy theme of Fallout was always how propaganda creates radicalism, both in Pre-War America (which led to the Great War), and also in Post-War America, all factions seem to fall prey to the same tribalism and rhetoric of the past. In most cases, out of ignorance of the fact they are repeating the past in the first place. Characters constantly touch on these subjects, it's very hard to miss while also being present in basically every game.

As Deacon always seems to be the ""meta"" character who seems to know a little to much and see a little to much, often times to the point of almost seeming like a 4th wall breaking character...This particular dialogue felt like something straight out of the 4th wall breaks more reminiscent of Spec Op's: The Line and other similar games like Bioshock or even Death Stranding.

I just found that pretty interesting, I think many companions and characters have similar ideas and things to say...but Deacon's felt very direct and comprehensible. Often times I feel that a lot of the major points and themes fly right over the heads of many Fallout fans and they actually unironically parrot out and believe the same satirical beliefs that the series criticizes so heavily. 

The only other character that has said it so directly that comes to my mind is Ulysses from Fallout New Vegas. I could see how his message could of been more difficult to understand though, given that his message is spread out across every aspect of Lonesome Road's narrative, so it's easier to miss or be confused.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's said war - war never changes. Men do, through the roads they walk. And this road - has reached it's end.

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose there are a lot of ways to interpret it. I personally resonate a lot with the very anti-nationalist and anti-war messages of the Fallout series due to the fact I myself am a veteran that has a fair share of problems and challenges due to my times deployed...as well as other non-military related issues. I always felt this franchise spoke to me, it always made sense to me. I hope it's message reaches out to others as well. I don't agree with a lot of what Bethesda does, but their story team is phenominal and out of the inspirations of a game like Wasteland, Tim Cain managed to create one of the only franchises that speaks to the lessons I've learned throughout my life.

I think Cait does not want weak friends and considers them liability. Like someone who will always seek help and never provide it. She perceives settlers as weak. She also perceives Brotherhood of Steel as weak early in the game because they barely survived attack of feral ghouls. 

She might not be completely wrong about it, but, on the other hand, powerful friends might consider her weak, as well.

1175,Breaking the “brotherhood is bad” argument,1600629399,"Hello redditors, some of you may have seen me arguing in favor of Maxsons brotherhood of steel and how they are good. This post is to prove once and for all that the brotherhood is good, on par with the minute men good. I will be addressing the arguments that are most common and using the lore and real life examples to prove that they are justified.




1. “They kill sentient ghouls and supermutants”

No, no they don’t. Have you ever seen an example of them shooting a ghoul or a sentient super mutant? Anyone? Not just gameplay but in real lore. You could say they wanted to kill Virgil but that wasn’t because he was a super mutant. If you ask Kells “why kill Virgil” he says that he used the commonwealth as his Petri dish and caused thousands of lives. And as an experiment I killed a ghoul in front of Danse and he yelled at me so apparently the brotherhood DOESNT want you to kill them.


2. “They kill synths”


And? Does anyone realize how dangerous they are? They are nigh undetectable and better than us in EVERY WAY how is that not terrifying? Remember the Neanderthals? I’m sure you don’t, we lived peacefully amount them and guess what? They died out, we outcompeted them and they died. We didn’t even try to take them out, and they still died. 



3. “They steal food from farmers”

No TEAGAN does, he explicitly says that this is off the books and not official and that the higher ups don’t know about it. And even if I’m wrong, the brotherhood does so much for the commonwealth. So I think the farmers can be fine and ration their food. They are perfectly capable of giving food to the minute men even before you build up their settlements. 


4. “They steal and kill for technology”

Quite the opposite actually, deacon (Macredy?)has something very interesting to say about this. (Paraphrased) “Ah the Capital wasteland, exports water and some decent tech” so it turns out they don’t steal for tech, they are apparently pretty flexible when it comes to tech. 


5. “They stole rivit citie’s generator”

Ummm, have any proof? Even if they did there isn’t proof that they stole it. It could have been a swap, they could have bought it, it could have been a gift, or they could have had an extra. There isn’t proof that they stole it whatsoever.


Anyway I hope this clears things up, lemme know if I missed anything.

This game is leagues better than I was expecting (not sure how much to attribute this to the recent Wastlanders update), but I have some questions regarding how to play and some advice for a mainly solo player. Thank you in advance! 

1. What are some ways I can have the best possible solo experience? Any tips or advice on how to play the game that make it the best for solo play, whether this be questing in a certain order, or doing certain things in the game I’m not yet familiar with?

2. I suffer from an unnamed condition where I prefer to tackle areas of an open world map one at a time. I find myself really hesitant to go into new areas if I still feel like I can do more in another. I think this is mainly a way to keep the map fresh and make it so I always have more to explore. So far, I have spent all of my time in the forest and ash heap. Is there an order I should explore the areas of the map in?

1209,Having to beat up NPCs you hate without consequence feels cathartic and blissful.,1600586947,"I have a mod, the Solid Project by TommInfinite and friends. A now-defunct overhaul mod since his departure on the modding scene. Which could have been the best one IMO since Project Nevada, if he haven't left. 

Anyway, along this overhaul is an option named ""Combat Takedowns"". Basically the this function enables your character to perform Fallout 4-like animated takedowns. ~~^(Tho the animations were straight ripped from Batman Arkham Series.)~~

I have been playing the mod for almost a year now, and just found out it had a ""Check for Crime"" option, which determines an NPC reaction of that faction. Basically if you perform a takedown of a, for example, a legionnaire in front of his fellow legionnaires, the latter will swarm on you and you get a negative rep, similar to killing them, Tho the quick takedowns serve to debilitate the target NPC for a few in-game hours of your choosing.

So I tried with the said option, off; and thought of the immediate most annoying/or asshole NPC and chose... Caleb McCaffery, that guy from Atomic Wrangler and yes I'm aware that you kill him eventually.

So I quicksaved, and then performed the takedown on him. My courier just went up on him and wrung him over his back then connects a kick to his spine as he threw Caleb over. Caleb was out cold (not dead) and the other NPCs just went about their business as if nothing happened. **It works!** But I had my doubts, to really test this for real. So I went to the Correctional Facility where the Powder gangers were. Smack dab in the middle of a hornet's nest.

I still haven't done the Goodsprings quest, so I'm still neutral on their rep. So I went for Scrambler, that tough-guy-wannabe and performed the takedown. My courier just decks him at the gut then finishes it off with a brutal punch to the back of the head (ouch), knocking him out. And to my surprise, the gangers whom were supposed to be ganging up on me just stayed neutral to the brutal beating in front of them. It works and it felt awesome and kinda therapeutic in a way. And it works on ANY npc, even creatures, tho I just use it on human NPCs.

So goodbye save-scum kills, sometimes you just need to deck that annoyance in the face. Oh and you can also loot them while they're unconscious. So thanks for the lunch money.",Fallout,UTKujo,False,/r/Fallout/comments/iw9d9i/having_to_beat_up_npcs_you_hate_without/,1

1257,Fallout 4: any tips on how to combat insta deaths on survival mode?,1600525068,"I've been playing Fallout 4 since it's release. Bought all the DLC and everything. So when survival mode difficulty came out, I instantly loved it since games like 7 Days To Die and such make you give crucial attention to things like illnesses, energy, hunger, thirst, etc. Having played Fallout 3 and New Vegas and NV's hardcore mode, Fallout 4 reached new heights to me. To this day, I still find myself getting caught with my pants down and dying damn near instantly in survival mode. So are there any tips yall can give to to me? I'm posting this because I literally just died by a stupid automatron that literally .0000000001 second before I destroyed it, decided to go into self destruct mode. Therefore, when it's health was gone, it blew up instantly and killed me. I have 5 endurance, all 3 life giver perks and 1 perk of toughness, Didn't think toughness would be so valid because of the strong armor I found early on. I am currently lvl 36 and can't seem to stop dying quickly. Is the game just stupidly hard because of the survival mode or do I just have a weak player? I find myself almost dying by super mutants all the time and looting their bodies only to find a few .38 rounds and a pipe rifle. I don't think I've survived a single explosion or random raider occurrence this game has thrown at me while playing survival mode. I will say that having 2 perks of inspirational has made a significant difference as I just give Curie all my grenades and let her go ham. Lol.

1263,Me playing my first fallout game,1600515326,"So i just started fallout 4 a year ago, and i bought it cause of great reviews and low price. I didn't mind to see much gameplay and just saw few promotional screenshots, but gameplay seemed kinda dull but as review praised it a lot i bought it anyway.

The first time i booted the game and have my first look at the graphics i just said , ""What the heck?"" The graphics were so horrible and the animations were so bad i literally regretted my decision on purchasing it. I played it for like less than an hour and just kept the disc in my shelf and never saw that game again. Yes, never. It was my 2nd RPG and i didn't know shit about RPG even after completing whole witcher 3 by rolling and dodging because i was carrying too much, but i thought the game was broken that's why i can't run, i was new in gaming then.

This year i decided to try fallout 4 again. Cause i was having nothing else to play, and i was not ordering anything from anywhere cause i am scared af of corona. So i booted up the game again, but this time i was more interested in dialogues of characters and what was going in the world rather than graphics or gameplay ( i have become more mature during this 1 year). And tbh i know very little, that vault tec boy (i just gave him random stats cause i don't know what the hell they were) i just knew that we have a kid and nuclear bomb was going to fell. So when we get out of the house we ran towards the vault and at that moment the game kicked up it's vibe. Nuclear bombs going to fall, alarms going off everywhere, people panicking. As the graphics and gameplay was very bad this moment wasn't that much impactful but as i have learnt to imagine i could totally understand how serious was the situation. When i reached the gate i then learnt that guy was actually writing our name for entrance and lol he didn't himself was allowed to enter. Ok so when we were standing over the platform and the bombs fell, this gave me shiver this time. As i take my time and reached there in like half and hour after starting, and therefore could feel much better about how bad is the situation. And then i played on and on, the scene where we came out of vault was truly one in a lifetime experience. It was so awesome, and the world was felt so real at particular moment. I then continued playing it.

I have now over 700 hours in that game and truly one of the best games i have ever played. I learnt that games have their own universe, lore, and a RPG genre exists. I am so lost in this world. Inspired by this game i decided to bring skyrim special edition (unfortunately i have to bring digital, i am still old school and like physical but worth it anyway). Again graphics and gameplay was horrible but as i have now learnt graphics don't matter much after playing fallout i brought that game. It was hard at first cause the universe and lore were so vast. But after studying everything that game was so enjoyable. 500 hours into that one and no regret. Fallout 4 was my first fallout game and it was truly the one who actually made me understand how RPG works cause everything comes on screen as a small message and the controls were quite understandable. And that workshop thing was so damn addictive, i can't believe i have wasted so much hours just in that one aspect of game. And weapons modifications were so overwhelming. I don't care about others fallout games for now. I will probably not play them but seriously bethesda has done some great job in creating such games likes this.

1289,My fallout 4 won't work anymore ):,1600472542,"To start off and get straight to the issue, when I try to start a new game, the game starts loading as normal, but then it switches to a black screen with the loading symbol in the bottom right. It does that for about a minute or two, and then it switches to the pause menu (like it would if you pressed pause in a normal game) and it lets me do every option except for quicksave and save. If I press ""O"" on ps4, it exits the pause menu and switches off of the black screen with the loading symbol to just a black screen. From there, there is nothing I can do except close the game by going to the PlayStation home screen.

Some things that you should know is I had two play throughs (one I was 6 1/2 hours into and the other I was about 3) that when I tried loading into, whenever I would die and automatically reload a previous save, it would give me the error code that either the disc was dirty (not the case cause I haven't touched a disc in over 3 years) or that the data was corrupted. After I found this out, I tried looking these things up and found one possible solution that had me delete the corrupted data (which I thought was the saves that didn't work). This didn't do anything. The last things you should also know is that I tried deleting the game and reinstalling, I tried repairing the storage or whatever (from the ps4 screen that you have to completely turn your ps4 off to get to), and It wouldn't let me load a new save when I tried to on those two playthroughs.

1292,"Wait, is that it?",1600468785,"I just finished the Pitt in one sitting and what the hell did I play? First, some guy just tells me to sell myself as a slave so a plan (he told me nothing about) could work out. Then I go there, get constantly insulted, fight some freaky creatures and am forced to fight in an Arena. This all to a cure to some disease I know pretty much nothing about. Finally after going through all this shit, I get to Asher and am presented with a choice of either kidnapping a child or killing off the slaves. Excuse me? This escalated very quickly, didn't it?

I see this scientist being excited about her child being immune which could mean the end of said disease I still know nothing about. I pass a science check, she's surprised I know Science and she drops some info about the plague.

Their daughter is probably the only chance at a cure, and she's the only person who can make said cure. 😑 OK? And why should I care about all this? I got an option to just scoop up the baby, but I refused. The slaves can't even read, and they're supposed to be able to produce a cure? I doubt it. So I leave.

Then outside, it turns out the slaves are revolting and they're my enemies now? What? Why? I didn't do anything. Oh well, probably a glitch. I go to the slave leader lady and tell her the cure isn't a cure, but a baby. I thought she didn't know. She did know, and still wanted me to kidnap the baby. Now she's mocking me for leaving them etc etc. And I'm just here like 👁️👄👁️. What the hell is happening right now? You can't make the cure idiot. You'll kill the baby and you'll all die. Can't you just wait a few more years and then take the actual cure?

I failed the speech check and had to kill her. And I lost Karma! What? She's the one that's being an idiot here? Then I head out to Werner. Maybe he got manipulated or something. Nope, he thought he can make a cure out of the baby without any medical knowledge. Then he accused me of falling in love with Asher, and it's pathetic that I left the slaves for him. Wow, I'm so invested.

Still in my 👁️👄👁️ face, I decide to kill Werner. He's an ass. I loose Karma. OK. I come back to Asher, he tells me I've saved the city, thanks to me slavery can be ended in a few years because their babies won't become mutants or something. He's making me ambassador, gives me access to an ammo press and I get a trophy for finishing the DLC.

.....😑..... Guys, what just happened? Was this supposed to be a brain hurting dilemma? Was I supposed to give the baby to the slaves, so they could eat her and become immune or something?

1294,Some tweaks I would do to make the Institute a better faction.,1600465748,"I think the Institute could still fulfill its role in the plot and world but would make more sense as an organization with just a few tweaks, mostly to some of its motivations and dialogue, generally centered around making them less evil but still bad and deeply misguided. 

1) Motive: One idea that's sort of in there but not explicit enough, is that the Institute believes Humans aren't strong enough to survive. This would explain why they were working on the Cybernetic Enhancements they gave Kellogg, why they used FEV to make mutants, and why they stated making Gen 3 synths. This is a motive very similar to that of The Master from Fo1, who thought humans couldn't survive the wasteland. Plus, if they had a clearer theme, then it would be satisfying to prove them wrong by showing what humans were able to accomplish, and showing them the Minutemen rebuilt and defending the Commonwealth as a testament to the human spirit. 

2) The Super Mutants: It's weird how many Super Mutants there are given that theoretically the Institute would have had to kidnap every single one of them when they were human, and then release them all into the wild for reasons unclear. The Institute should also have known they were violent and dangerous, so their decision makes even less sense. So, the change I would make would be this: They tested the FEV on raider camps. They didn't know how well it would work, so they tested it on Raiders because they figured if the raiders died then, hey, they were just raiders, they should've been killed anyway, and if the FEV did work, then they could just send in some synths to clean up the survivors, perform some autopsies, and refine the strain. This would explain the large numbers, since there were a lot of raiders and they would've been tested in groups, and the violence, because they were violent already, and since 2 and NV had smart, non-violent super mutants, it's a little lazy to just say they're bad because they're mutants. (You can say the vault 87 strain was bad, but there's no reason the Institute wouldn't have had its own strain.) All you'd actually have to change in the game is have maybe a couple more nice mutants who were collateral damage when the raiders got hit (you can say they're still a little off but not totally evil), and give the SMs some occasional Institute weapons, to show that they fought some synths. 

(Yes, I know they're there for gameplay reasons, but I think you could write them in more convincingly)

3) Synths: I think the Synths-are-Slaves thing is a little simplistic, given that the Institute has the whole ""Mankind Redefined"" thing going on, and especially under the slight rewrite I'm doing. They also already have Gen 2's, which are pretty intelligent, and can easily fulfill the worker role. Instead, the Gen 3's really should be an attempt at creating sentient life, that could one day be even better than humanity. Except, I think the Institute should be really paranoid about them, almost as paranoid as the rest of the commonwealth. The Broken Mask incident, which seems to have been the first time a Gen 3 was tested in the outside world, resulted in many innocent people getting murdered when the Synth malfunctioned, and I think that this should have effects on both the Commonwealth and the Institute. The scientists there still believe in the project, and are always trying to improve the design, and make them smarter and more human, but are still very worried about glitchiness and the general unpredictability that comes with that humanity, and this carries two risks for the synths. First, if they do glitch, the Institute will very quickly have them destroyed, and second, they may be destroyed once they become obsolete. This would give them a very solid motivation for them to try and flee the Institute, thus justifying the existence of and conflict with The Railroad, but also justifying the Institute hunting them down, since they genuinely believe that a rogue synth could be a danger to anyone around it. Whether the Synths are people and have a right to live would still be a core point of contention. Coursers you could justify as having significantly reduced emotional functions, which reduces the risk of them glitching or going rogue, thus allowing the Institute to give them significantly enhanced physical strength and agility, while also making them less likely to sympathize with any rogue synth they are pursuing. There could still be Synth infiltrators, but they would only be used under special circumstances, such as taking over Diamond city, and when certain experiments need to be done, like at that farm at the sewage treatment plant. You could also maybe give them a policy of only replacing bad people with synths, since the farmer was noticeably nicer after he was replaced, and you could say Murphy was corrupt, but that might make them a little too nice. 

4) Tech: This is less of a story thing, but I think they should have somewhat better tech than they do. At least comparable in most areas to OWB level stuff. 

\- It would be cool if they could do some form of weather control, especially if they were the ones who created radstorms in order to mask their movements; if everyone's hiding inside, it's easier to move around. No one else does whether except one big MT facility and the Brotherhoods sand blowers (and you with fireworks in one of the workshop add-ons), so it would be a good niche for them to move into. 

\-Their weapons should be stronger, everyone knows this, everyone else has already commented that it's weird that they have spent 200 years creating a worse laser gun. I think instead of laser guns, they should have LAER/Pulse Rifle style electrical weapons that are specifically designed to use against synths, and have the added bonus of working well on power armor, making them more of a threat to both you and the Brotherhood. A sonic weapon would also be nice, though one more grounded that the OWB one, that mostly sticks to vibrations that penetrate through armor. 

\-Some form of power armor, like the kind in the concept art, it could maybe even self destruct upon the operator's defeat if they didn't want you to get your hands on it too early. 

\-Maybe some form of energy shielding/photonic resonance barrier, maybe in the armor, but at least used somewhere. It's in use by less advanced factions, so if they're the most advanced they should have it. Even though they seem to have found that blast doors work fine. And are less easy to fry. So maybe that's an improvement.

1303,Bethesda seems to have a not so favorable view of scientists in Fallout. (Spoilers),1600454608,"1 . FO3 starts with your scientist dad saying fuck the vault, and leaves to pursue his pet project without telling anyone (even you, his child) leaving ruin his wake and causing several vault 101 residents to die awful deaths. When you find him, he doesn't seem to care much about any of that and in fact, immediately sends you into a super mutant infested death pit on his behalf because MY EXPERIMENT, BRO. To be fair, there's nuance here because his goal is ultimately altruistic and he does sacrifice himself for project purity.

2. Lesko from the quest Those! created super ants that killed everyone in Grayditch and when you present this fact to him, he doesn't give a fuck.

3. Then you meet Madison Li, whose primary character trait, as highlighted by how other characters speak of her in both games, is that she is an unlikable crank.

4. Same with Professor Scara if you fail to recruit Li during the BoS questline in FO4.

5. The Institute scientists, especially Shaun, are portrayed as being callous about human life if not downright villainous. On average, they find it acceptable to murder people and replace them with robot clones ""for science"". The rationale being ""mankind redefined"" or whatever, even though they themselves don't see their own synths as alive and worthy of human dignity.

6. Maxson's BoS in Fallout 4, whose main mission revolves around science and technology, and has many scientists in its ranks, are possibly implied neo-nazis. Debatable whether that's actually true in context (I don't think so) but Bethesda wasn't exactly subtle with the allusions to fascism.

I'm sure there are some positive representations of scientists mixed in there (Amari comes to mind) but it definitely skews negative overall.

1311,Bethesda's development process. What is it?,1600450292,"So here's a question I've had for a bit and given what I know about game development in general I've got some theories. But generally speaking I wanted to ask about it here.

Does anyone know what Bethesda's game development process is for these games?

As with anything, with game design there is a proper way to do production. Or a recommended set of steps. Like with movie production. You want to have your script nailed down before you start in on set building, and you want editing done before you add in CGI in post production. It's all about efficient use of time and not wasting money.

So Fallout 76 is what really gave me this theory. It's got a fantastic map. An amazingly deep and nuanced one with so much character to it. Which is a shame as it was (at launch) the most empty, soulless Fallout game so far. I'm not saying it wasn't enjoyable. Just that there were almost no NPCs, voice acting was minimal, and quest lines were rather simplistic compared to previous entries.  
So to me, this result only makes sense IF map design and creation maybe comes first after initial writing and pre-production. They design the game, get the concept art up, then put a team on mapping. After that, start work on NPCs, voice acting, quest design, and that detailed content. Then start implementing the second on the mostly finished map and make changes as needed, adding in locations for new quests they thought up. Either that or the mapping team is for some reason a separate team or is somehow separate from other parts of the dev process. Like I said, I'm guessing here.

Looking back at Fallout 4, and Skyrim, I can see some evidence that might support this, though more in F4 than Skyrim. Things like the southern map of Fallout 4 being richly designed, but scarce in quests. Like, Qunicy, the Gunners HQ and vault 95. Well designed and made, but very light on quest and story content. Meanwhile on the top half of the map, most locations have some story work, even if minor, put into them. Like the foundry for instance.

As I said, this is just me guessing. I know nothing concrete about this.

In the 3D fallouts you can charge into a room of 30 enemies and, if you use cover effectively, can kill them all with relative ease. Whereas is the classic fallouts due to the turn based combat you cannot, which makes your character feel less like a super human. Furthermore it also forces you to come up with other solutions to the quests, which leads to more interesting games.

Thats what i think, but im curious to know what others think to it, since a big part of newer fans not playing the classics is the combat.

1340,Underrated Quests?,1600385849,"I was playing through Fallout: New Vegas again and stumbled, as I have many times, into North Vegas. I've never really felt a huge need to go *to* North Vegas- IIRC there's no major questlines that bring you there, and Westside / Freeside both have better merchants, sidequests, and ambient NPCs. 

There is exactly one reason I go to North Vegas, and that reason is ""Someone To Watch Over Me"".

Someone To Watch Over Me is the only marked quest in Vanilla FNV that is started in North Vegas- there's an unmarked quest regarding Jules that gets you an ammo recipe, but I've never been much for hand-made ammo in this game outside of shotgun rounds. The quest is multi-staged, with the first two stages being entirely unremarkable 'go talk to these people and make them go away' quests, either through violence, speech, or barter. 

It's the third stage of the quest that I like so much, and it's not because it's this long, drawn out affair, it's not because it's such an arduous task to complete, but because it has so little to do with the story. There's no factions involved, there's no overarching story plot that is revealed to you, there's not even much of an element of Fallout to it other than the fact that Andy, the quest stage's arguable antagonist, is a ghoul. That's precisely why I like it- the final stage of Someone To Watch Over Me is realistic in a way that, on first playthrough, hit me rather hard. 

Alice Hostetler is a girl who fell in with the wrong crowd and has been led by her circumstances to believe that there is no other way out, and in the Hostetler house you have the opportunity to make a choice that does very little to affect the game for you at large other than change your Karma. But for me, playing both Good and Evil couriers as time has passed, I've enjoyed coming back to this quest for the roleplay value alone.

1350,What Fallout 4 means to me.,1600368988,"There is always a discussion of each games in the Fallout series and on a variety of topics. From which one is their favorite game, to what has the best story, and which one appeals to each individual player. Sometimes we get into the nitty gritty and specific details that makes each game stand out.

So how did Fallout 4 stand out to me apart from the rest of the series? 

Well, early in the game Garvey takes the last survivors of Quincy to  Sanctuary, they cross that bridge. The bridge where the first shots of the Revolutionary War began. At the foot of that bridge stood a statue to represent the Minutemen. Just a Militia made up of colonist. Farmers more or less.

This represents the heart and soul, the spirit of America. The reason it was formed into a Nation. It stood up to the tyranny of its time. When I look at the color palette chosen for this game I get a sense of that spirit never really dying off. A part of America that was spared. To me it signifies that no matter how hard we get knocked down, war and nukes no less, we still find a way to rebuild.

So the game takes place as a SS of a Vault Tech experiment gone wrong. Typical of a fallout game, but it breathes life into this series in a unique way.

You are placed in a chaotic time with multiple factions. Super Mutants, Mercenaries (Gunners), Raiders, and creatures of every kind. The Commonwealth is divided, leaderless. (on account of the Institute.)  

Once again you are put in a time at the brink of War. Only the bravest factions will represent how that unity of the Commonwealth will come about. Just like the  founding ""fathers"" you have to choose who is going to unite the United  States. Or in this case the Commonwealth.

Is it the Minutemen? A militia of settlers, farmers, and remnants of its past glory since its defense of Diamond City.

The Railroad. Synth loving freedom fighters that represent a secret underground organization called the Underground Railroad that was organized to help people escape the horrors of slavery. Are they misguided or does every living thing, synth included, deserve the right to live?

The Brotherhood of Steel. The Pride of the US Military in a Tin Can. Set out to liberate the Commonwealth from the threat of a technology that would one day replace all humans, the Institute. This faction being a veteran in the series really shines when that blimp shows up. A sign of their superiority.      Will they stick to their guns? Ridding us of the Institute infection? Or ask local farmers for help since they forgot to pack a lunch?  (good thing the minutemen have been building up settlements to keep up with demand for food after this exodus into the Commonwealth.)

Or is it the Institute? A xenophobic society that kept much to itself. Taking science to the next level. in 200 years its pretty easy to create all types of technology with unlimited resources at their disposal. And without that government red tape. Don't you hate it when you have someone staring over your shoulder while you work? Well the institute fixed that. By going underground.

But how did they get these resources? Naturally they took it by force. destroying settlements, taking over key technology sites all over Boston. But they didn't stop there, with a government or council forming on the surface to discuss peace and unity they sought to destroy what would be a threat to them in event known as the CPG Massacre.

At that point no one on the surface could be trusted. They looked to their machines. Finding more ways to improve them. To improve humans. And then they found a young baby. Locked behind a vault door. Perfectly preserved from the fallout. Using him as a basis they created the ultimate machine. A synth. Indistinguishable from any other human. They could imitate anything a normal human could do. With this they wanted to make their presence known. The fake mask event in Diamond City. A replaced human being sent in to cause terror in the hearts of the people. And then the shooting began. What better way to show they mean business than by planting their creation where it would be hard to miss.

Through fear and terror of a monster hidden in the shadows they went dormant. Possibly to one day replace all humans and to bring order to chaos. If they can control whats on the surface there won't be anymore killing. No more raiders, super mutants, or factions. Just Synths.

To me the color palette of the game represented the Red White and Blue. The colors of the American Flag, but also the revolutionary spirit of America. And a place to rebuild a life upon the old world. 

Whatever faction you continue on with, you are still allowed to continue to build the commonwealth through its myriad of settlements. Should be be the Minutemen with its artillery at every settlement with the most coverage to expunge any external threat at a minutes notice?

Fly in a squad of tin can of super soldiers with the BoS?

Teleport in a robotic army anywhere?

Something that just sorta occurred to me about VATS, and it's in-universe explanations:

First, a caveat: the original reason for VATS was simply to provide some method for aiming in a non-FPS game, and percentages and APs just a way to inform players.  It makes sense to just ignore it in that situation, but I think there's some interesting speculation to be had regarding it's appearance and behavior in later Fallout games.

tl;dr: The Sole Survivor doesn't have VATS because they're a synth, VATS is based on a characteristic of the SS, and the synth implants based on genes ""inherited"" from the SS.

**In-game Info**

The Institute has a terminal entry strongly implying they can surgically implant something which creates VATS-like capabilities.  (This is a core part of the argument that the Sole Survivor is a synth.)  Key words: surgically implant.

Gen3 synths carry some of the Sole Survivor's DNA, by way of Shaun.  Since they look wildly different *and* because only some are capable of the VATS-like enhancement, probably to varying degrees.  It makes sense, experimentally, to have different ""genetic mixes"" to evaluate.

In Fallout 3 as the Institute-side rewards for the Replicated Man quest, you can get an implant that increases your VATS hit chance.  However, there's basically no way the Lone Wanderer could be a gen 3 synth.  So that tells us that enhancing VATS behavior through implants isn't a synth-only thing.

**Real-world Info**

There's the ""flow state"", or ""being in the zone"".  It puts you in a state of extreme focus, where action and awareness are more closely linked than normal, a feeling of control, a perceived stretching of time.

Sounds kinda like VATS, right?

**Speculation**

*Natural ""VATS""*

The Sole Survivor isn't using ""VATS"" without a Pipboy, they just have a natural inclination.  A *genetic* one.  The Pipboy helps, but they don't necessarily realize to what degree it does or doesn't.

It'd make sense for either Nate or Nora:

* Nate's a combat vet.  Being able to ""zone in"" and make careful, rational decisions in combat would go a long way to ensuring survival.
* Nora's a lawyer, and would spend a lot of time digging through masses of information.  Being able to get in the zone would help collate information, observe witness reactions, and generally do lawyery things.  I don't think it'd be hard or even odd for her to ""re-purpose"" that ability for combat.

*VATS*

Vault-Tec knew of the flow state, figure how it'd be useful for combat, then piddled around and figured out to induce a flow state on-demand.  I think it's obvious how ""extreme concentration, improved observation-decision-action loop, extended sense of time"" would be a huge boon in combat.  (See: [OODA loop]( I can't imagine how they did that in a Pipboy, but I'm willing to lump it under ""Stuff that doesn't make sense in the real world but is canon, so just accept it"".

*The Institute's Research into VATS/Related Techniques*

I believe there's two general possibilities for the Institute's ""VATS"": they knew of VATS and were deliberately trying to implement it, or they just happened on the same line of reasoning.  I don't think the specifics really matter, ultimately the Institute was working towards the same concept, but couldn't just ""copy-paste"" the technique.

By the time the Sole Survivor rolls up with a working Pipboy and experience, the Institute was already far enough into development they weren't interested.  Or, at least, weren't interested enough to distract the SS from more pressing tasks.  (Unless the SS decides to side with anyone else, in which case the Institute just didn't have time to worry about it before being turned into a crater.)

*Visual Feedback On the Screen vs In-game*

A lot of the visual ""stuff"" in the game's HUD don't make sense literally, but do as a method for displaying things the player--as opposed to the character--can't be inherently aware of.  E.g. people don't have health bars, but do have pain and similar feedback so a person knows their general status; so the game adds a health bar to replace that tactile data with visual.

So the percentages and highlights in VATS may not actually be present, they're just a game mechanic to represent something a computer can't otherwise relay: the character's experience and expertise telling them how likely they are to perform a certain action.

*Other Capabilities Rolled Into ""VATS""*

There's a behavior known in hunting circles as ""buck fever"": people get a bit excited, adrenaline hits the bloodstream, and they start shaking almost uncontrollably.  I understand something similar happens to soldiers in combat or police in shooting situations.

The various VATS accuracy improvements could just be the system counteracting adverse conditions.  If Vault-Tec could induce a flow state, why couldn't they also calm someone down so their aim is better?

**At Long Last, the Conclusion**

The SS uses ""VATS"" before getting a Pipboy simply because they're capable of doing so on-demand anyway.  The Pipboy and such may help the process along, though.

The visual highlights are purely game mechanics, not something that's an in-universe effect of VATS.

This characteristic is at least partly genetic, and not terribly common.  Perhaps it's not enough of an advantage historically to be evolutionarily desirable (so to speak), but also either not a downside or not enough to impair survival.

Since most people lack the genetic predisposition, the Pipboy allows them to consciously--albeit artificially--enter a flow state.

The Institute's original implants--seen in Fallout 3--only enhance a flow-state, rather than inducing one, but the Pipboy's induced flow state suits.

Synths with the ""VATS gene"" from the SS are limited from entering the state, I'd say accidentally by their programming.  However, later versions of the implant can cause them to enter the state.

**Tangent**

Psycho, Jet, and various other chems are maybe a third development of the principals behind VATS and the Institute implants.  Easier to produce, but far more significant and adverse side-effects.",Fallout,allannon,False,/r/Fallout/comments/iue4ek/vats_synths_and_cybernetic_implants/,1

1415,76 is annoying close to being a really good game,1600289940,"Now, I'm not saying that 76 is a pretty good game that needs a little more polish, because it's got some real flaws, what I'm saying is that there's an alternate universe very close to ours with a really good 76. 

If they had taken the story and the setting and the factions they made, and just used them it could've been really good. The Responders/Firebreathers, Free Staters, and Brotherhood of Steel had a really good conflict dynamic going on. They had a lot of mutual distrust and friction, but they all had the common goal of fighting the Scorched to save Appalachia and the world. It could've been a great story trying to unify all of those factions while also trying to fight the scorched and the plague at the same time, maybe dealing with some raiders and the Enclave, or even having to work together with the Enclave because of their tech, and also getting to fight crime with the Mistress of Mystery and her Mysterettes. It's a story and a world and a conflict that I'm interested in, and they set it all up and then made you read about it on everyone's emails. It would be super easy to inject the player into the world too, all you have to do is make the vault open after 5 years instead of 20. Maybe you were a scout or something. 

Plus, the world design was great. They had all of those visually distinctive regions/Biomes, with way more wildlife and cool creatures than any of the other games. The Cryptids were awesome, and I loved seeing little mutated beavers and frogs hanging around. Plus the Mole Miners are really cool. Also, Dragon Bats that use echolocation blasts are cool, even if the AI was pretty wonky. 

It had a lot of cool weapons too, even though it had the worst weapon balance of any Fallout game, and sledgehammers and some of the heavy guns were basically the only good options, there were a lot of cool designs. They brought back some of the cool stuff from NV like the grenade machinegun and the chainsaw (which you can now set on fire), and added some cool stuff of their own like the gatling plasma, gatling gun, .50 Cal machine gun, and The Dragon with it's comically long reload time. These would be super cool weapons if they were balanced for single player instead of  not-really-balanced-at-all for multiplayer. 

What's annoying is that it doesn't even feel like they made it multiplayer to cut corners since getting it to work required a crudload of patches and a lot of engine changes, and if they had just taken an extra year and filled the world with survivors and told the story they were already telling it would've been much better and not required them to basically re-make the game.

It's quite possible that they just wanted to do the games-as-service microtransactions cash cow thing, but, Fallout 4 made them somethings like 500-600 million dollars, and Skyrim made them over a billion dollars, so it seems like they should have noticed that people will pay good money for their single player games, and since fallout 76 sold about 2.5 million copies it can't possibly have been a good investment.

Step 2: Complete ""Reunions"" and ""Dangerous Minds."" (For proper completion, keep Preston at the Castle.)

Step 3:
(a) You will have received ""Tradecraft"" and ""Shadow of Steel."" DO NOT advance in either of these quests.
(b) Focus on the Minutemen as you continue down the main quest line. Use the Minutemen to gain access to the Institute.
(c) Get yourself banished from the Institute. You can play along and poke around for a bit first if you like, but if you do, you'll have to murder someone to get banished (might we suggest those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s down in synth retention?). You may safely complete ""Institutionalized,"" but do not progress any farther before getting yourself kicked out. Don't even speak to Father again after completing ""Institutionalized."" DO NOT complete ""Synth Retention."" (Give holotape to Sturges.)

Step 4:
(a) You will have received ""Form Ranks"" for the Minutemen. DO NOT advance this quest.
(b) DO NOT start ""Defend the Castle."" Don't even go to the Castle.
(c) Complete all quests for the Brotherhood from ""Shadow of Steel"" to ""Show No Mercy."" DO NOT complete ""Show No Mercy."" Don't even get on the Vertibird. Grab ALL side quests from the Brotherhood and keep them open.

Step 5: Complete ""Form Ranks"" and ""Defend the Castle."" Start ""The Nuclear Option"" for the Minutemen but DO NOT complete it.

Step 6: Complete all Railroad quests from ""Tradecraft"" to ""Randolph Safehouse 6.""

Step 7: Complete ""The Nuclear Option.""

That's it! This process will result in all factions loving you. The heads of the Brotherhood will praise your actions (except Max, who is pouting and won't talk to you). From here on out, they will not start fights and will only kill mutants and raiders. Many of their quests and side quests are repeatable. The Railroad has a whole new line of quests for you, and there is fun to be had everywhere (however, don't talk to P.A.M. after this; she wants to start a war with the Brotherhood). Enjoy your (relatively) peace-filled Commonwealth!

(BTW, if one of your companions is being attacked by another faction, this is most likely because they got hit with some crossfire while in a multi-faction battle and then shot back. This happens often...and is annoying as hell. Danse will shoot down his own Vertibird then leave you because he is mad that you shot down his friends. Yeah.)”

You've slightly moved the front line, but there's still a huge Legion force right on the other side of the river, and it doesn't feel like you actually won the war. 

In the other fallout games, you always defeat the bad guy and resolve the conflict, 1 you kill the Lieutenant and the Master, 2 you blow up the rig, 3 you take out all of the Enclave's bases, and 4 you kill whichever factions you didn't side with, but in New Vegas Hoover Dam just feels like the first battle in the 2nd phase of the war between the Legion and the NCR. Is the Legion just going to crumple without Lanius and Caesar? Because I didn't quite get that impression.

Everyone had their own opinions on which game is best, but any suggestion on which one to grab if only one was an option?
   

I’m leaning more towards Fallout 4 at this point.  But I’m curious as to what the community suggests to a first time player of the series",Fallout,LidgChris,False,/r/Fallout/comments/it67r0/which_game_to_start_with/,1
1515,Fallout 3 is my favorite fallout game and here's why.,1600163274,"I Love fallout 3 it's my favorite fallout game and here's why. And in case you're wondering I like fallout New Vegas but I love fallout 3 more. In fallout 3 you have the karma system if you do an evil deed like killing is it man you gain bad karma. But if you kill raiders and kill slavers you get good karma and it's so simple and getting good karma comes out on top in the end. Why because you get Fawkes an intelligent super mutant companion with a Gatling laser and then you have other companions. Jericho an old raider is megaton that tries to protect the town. Clover a slave girl with Stockholm syndrome. Sharon ghoul that's taller than any human character and ghoul character in the game. A brotherhood of steel paladin and dogmeat. But now let's talk about fallout 3 5 major DLCs

You have operation Anchorage in that DLC pack you have to go into a VR pod and go through a simulation a pre-war simulation Anchorage Alaska and go into the war that took place fighting the commies. and do you know what you get at the end after you leave the VR pod walk to the end of the hall use your Pip-Boy to open the terminal. And you get a Chinese stealth suit. Electric Chinese shock sword that does electric damage. A gauss rifle and for winterized suit of t51b power armor. Which to me when I play fallout 3 and it's DLCs that was my end game armor. 

Now we have broken steel this DLC pack takes place after the main game after you activate project purity. And either activate it and put in the modified fev or forced evolutionary virus. Or you could activate project purity without adding the modified fev. Giving clean and pure water to the wasteland. And it turns out the enclave has not been defeated and you need to fight and defeat the enclave. 


And now we have the third DLC pack mothership zeta. And in mothership zeta you get abducted by that zetan  aliens. You have to fight through the ship find pre-war people a little girl from 2077. an operation Anchorage soldier. The 13th century Japanese samurai and an old cowboy from the 18th century. and with mothership zeta you get new weapons alien rifle alien pistol to me these two weapons or two of the best weapons in the entire game you can't get the alien rifle in fallout New Vegas you can get an alien pistol but that's with a perk. Called wild wasteland. An Indian you defeat mothership zeta and now you have your own alien spaceship. 


And that we have point lookout which to me is one of my least favorite DLCs the first let's start with the negatives and then the positives. The first gripe in this case negative I have about point lookout is its story point lookout story is not interesting it's just the simple one man versus the other who comes out on top trope. A brain in a jar has a bunch of tribals that think he's a god. And then you have a 200 year old ghoul bigot that treat you like garbage and expects you to help him. there are a few good things about fallout 3 point lookout DLC it's the location and the enemies. Point lookout takes place in Maryland I think not entirely sure and either Maryland or Maine. But I'm not sure but now the new enemies. Dylan you enemies that come to point lookout are the hillbillies. There challenging and fun. 

And now the last DLC the PITT and the PITT is the darkest DLC in the game now let's talk about the pitt the pit take place in Pittsburgh. That is why it is called the pitt it is run on the back of slaves. Becoming disease and sick. And there's only two endings to this dlc. Kidnap a baby from her loving parents and give the baby to the slaves or don't kidnap the baby and have the slaves keep working. And least two endings there is no good ending they're both bad ending.

1530,What I think the Minutemen could have been.,1600143385,"I really enjoy the Minutemen in concept, just a band of Commonwealth settlers banding together to protect one another is just super cool.  However the in game Minutemen are just kinda lame, they have like two non-main quest related quests and the settlement quests.

So what would I change? First and foremost I would give them a more proper story line.  (SOME SPOILERS FOR THE MINUTEMEN)

\-Firstly I think the beginning works out well, you just going around helping a few settlements. In the base game after you help about 4 settlements Preston has you take the Castle but to me that's a slight jump ahead. I would have Preston warn you of a large group of Gunners moving up to Concord, you would lead the Minutemen in a fight with this Gunner Platoon.

\-A few days after this battle Preston would then tell you that he believes the Minutemen are ready to retake the castle. The Castle quest and the Artillery quest will transpire the way they do in game.

\-This is where more of a story comes into play, I would have the Minutemen quest line focus on taking down the Gunners and helping the Major settlements (Diamond City, Goodneighbor, Bunker Hill, etc).

\-After the Castle is secured Preston would next task you with retaking the overpasses from the Gunners. Once this is complete There would be a Huge battle to retake Quincy. There is a lot of references in game to the Quincy Massacre and I think the Minutemen retaking the settlement was a huge missed opportunity.

The Retaking of Quincy would I believe be a great climactic finish for the Minutemen's story as it would show the commonwealth that they are back in force.

MISC- Other random things that could have been added: More variety in the tasks for settlements (maybe recovering lost caravans or resolving a dispute of some kind idk maybe you have an idea), and mission where you help defend major settlements.",Fallout,_Colonel_Mustard_,False,/r/Fallout/comments/it1j4g/what_i_think_the_minutemen_could_have_been/,1

Even the wiki talks like there's no connection between the two.

Dean and Mr. Yesterday are never mentioned in the same terminal entries. People who were aware of ""Mr. Yesterday"" just don't mention Domino, while those referring to Domino never mention anything about the construction of the villa.

Domino was scamming Sinclair, and specifically trying to ruin him beyond the point of being able to recover, financially or otherwise. It completely makes sense that he would have been skimming money from the construction that Sinclair wouldn't have seen as much of. Dean also seems very aware of the flaws of the villa in his dialogue, some of which don't make any sense (like how did he know about the issues with the power distribution).

Weird?",1600129794,"I won't name any names because I don't want this *at all* to be a smack talk about anything or anyone, but in some of the Fallout-based sites and communities, there's quite a bit of important stuff like very exclusive interviews with some really important clarifications on lore and the series, and some really big and important downloads and patches, that are found on sites for communities that have some... Interesting opinions. 

To say the least, at least on a few visits I found the most prominent members believe things like *""Women shouldn't be in the gaming industry""* or *""This person who straight up sexually harrassed someone did nothing wrong""* , and uh, ""*This product Bethesda made for Fallout was specifically designed to make fun of us and old fans""* or *""I think it's a funny joke to make fun of a hypothetical woman being beaten and killed for not agreeing with me about Fallout""* and... A giant rainbow of 'Rape and prostitution' analogies every time a new piece of news came out about Fallout since the Bethesda acquisition in 2007. I mean... Like every other post. *""Bethesda \*\*\*\*\*\*'d Fallout in every orifice,"" ""Bethesda didn't even wait until Fallout was legal to \*\*\*\* and \*\*\*\*\* it, and \*\*\*\*\*\*\*""*... on more than one occasion some users straight up had Nazi image avatars and nazi-based names as a ""Joke"". From what I saw, there was even old deleted threads on some of these sites that straight up defended the idea of sending ""Rape and death threats"" to Bethesda. ^(...wtf?)

&amp;#x200B;

Now let me make it clear, in fact I'm a part of the people who love the classics, and I'm also mad about so much of the stuff that was lost, I firmly believe classic fans have so many very valid grievances with how Fallout has been handled, very much so, but even if there's ""Plenty of very fine people among the classic fans"" there's an undeniably massive amount of... Other stuff. Like I said above. Like. All over. And it's kinda embarassing? 

I run into it not just on fansites but on lots of certain communities, there's a really weird elitism that seems to stem from and permeate everywhere from that, to the point it's just kinda creepy and almost cultish. And some of them are of the opinion they should be the ones who are considered the ""only real fans"" and uh, you know, uh, that's kind of... Out there. I don't get why you'd think a video game is THAT important you'd go so far on the internet for that. I know there's elitism in all fandoms, but some of the stuff I saw really took the cake... 

And it's just the fact that you have to go to the places where these people are at to get the Good Stuff you need for stuff like Fallout 1 and 2 or to find real discussion on these games. It's in retrospect really embarrassing that some people's first impression of fans might be something like that if they're starting the series at the beginning and looking for stuff on it.

&amp;#x200B;

And Yeah, I do know there's people here who are also classic fans who go to those places and say ""They're not all like that!"" yeah, while that's true there's like a ton of stuff and people that are. One second a nice discussion goes into ""Yeah, well Fallout is now a poor beaten prostiute that got kicked in the head by her boss and is now being- (expletive rant)"" And it's just incredibly embarassing to see every other minute. Or almost every discussion about Bethesda that isn't overtly insulting to them having this underlying extremely passive-aggressive tone to it, and this isn't about Fallout 76, it's about Fallout 3. I mean, jeez, guys... Even 13 years later some of the few people are still like this...

&amp;#x200B;

And it's just really annoying that you will inevitably \*Have\* to encounter these type of people if you want to find certain resources for Fallout, the classic games, and older interviews with it's creators...

Just comparing Skyrim to Fallout 4, Skyrim is one and a half times 4's size, has almost twice as many quests, and has 9 cities compared to 4's, maybe 3 if you count vault 81. Plus, every single book in Skyrim has an actual story, some spanning 8 volumes and hundreds of in game pages! I mean, I know there was just another thread about this, but can you imagine if you could read a whole Grognak adventure over several comics, and maybe learn a new melee move from doing so? It would be dope! I know Fallout has some systems that Elder Scrolls doesn't, and more weapon variety (but no spells so it cancels out), but still, it feel like Elder Scrolls games just have more work put into them.

This specific companion would be named Adom, and he'd be revealed to be a former military scientist who was trapped in an underground research facility along with his comrades, where they all slowly ghoulified. Realizing their bodies would be weak and frail, they enhanced themselves. And then went their seperate ways.

Adom would eventually become a lawmen or sheriff in some Ghoul settlement, but he'd be willing to join up with the player. What do you guys think?",Fallout,Late-Print8646,False,/r/Fallout/comments/isuv63/new_ideas_for_companions_in_future_games/,1

1577,Fallout's Photography Conundrum,1600110030,"As a vintage camera enthusiast who has been playing a lot of Fallout 4 lately, something has been rattling around in my head quite a bit. How did the divergence influence the development of photography in the fallout world? We know that the tube TV was always the display norm, so resolution was never a big concern as far as film was concerned, but looking at the models of camera found in the game, that still begs some questions.

In Fallout 3, the only camera you'd find was a TLR with a basic flash. In New Vegas, we find that this camera does in fact have a zoom, so this doesn't wholly rule out developments to photographic technology. TLRs are great for high quality medium format shooting. That said, the only camera to be found in Fallout 4 is some variant on a Kodak box Brownie, specifically the Brownie Hawkeye. 

Now this does make some sense, as the Hawkeye was released right around the divergence point, but what puzzles me a bit is that it was a fairly limited camera. The flash model is what is found, but that's really the only feature it has. Otherwise it's just a fixed-lens, cheap box with a shutter and a long exposure switch.

This begs a few questions;

What was it that impacted the development of film so that 35mm never took over the market share of medium format?

Did hobby photography die out, thus leaving the only viable market basic family photography? Without digital, or cheap 35mm film, did the media have justification to downgrade to medium format exclusively? Why don't we see any large format cameras in the world?

What was it about the Brownie Hawkeye that persisted over a great few objectively superior brownie models?

I'm well aware I'm completely overthinking this, and that camera is only in the game because a modeler at Bethesda looked at that box Brownie and said ""huh, that's neat,"" but honestly I think about it way too much and just thought I'd float it out there for any other geeks like me to chew on...",Fallout,Anarcho_Royalist,False,/r/Fallout/comments/isrhds/fallouts_photography_conundrum/,1

1606,The Top 10 Most Powerful Factions in the Fallout Universe.,1600069920,"The following list will take into account not only the raw military power of these factions, but also their political influence, technological prowess, territorial control and popular support, as well. Non-canon factions will also be included in the list and all factions will be at their absolute peak potential strength. And now, without further ado, here's the top 10 most powerful factions in the entirety of the post-apocalyptic world:

10: The Free Economic Zone of New Vegas (Mr. House).

Under the iron-fisted rule of its self-proclaimed sole proprietor, President and C.E.O. Robert Edwin House, the Free Economic Zone of New Vegas (or simply the New Vegas Strip) is a more-or-less stable community that is massively well-protected by an army of hundreds of highly-advanced Securitrons packing 9mm SMGs for riot-control and close-quarters combat, Gatling Lasers for medium-range engagements, rapid-fire 25mm Grenade Launchers for neutralizing packs of enemies at close range, Missile Launchers for long-range engagements, titanium alloy housing that's highly-resistant to small arms fire and shrapnel and highly-sophisticated self-repair units (compliments of the Platinum Chip and the Mark.II Operating Software).

Which is really about all Mr. House has going for him. Don't get me wrong, the Securitron Army is indeed an incredibly powerful force that is most certainly capable of defeating most threats to the New Vegas Strip. The problem, however, is that several hundred Mk.II Securitrons at best simply wouldn't be anywhere near enough to deal with any organized adversaries that have decent technology and numbers. The above factions are most definitely more than a match for the Securitron Army and can very easily crush House's fledgling community without any serious trouble. Which is exactly why he's dead last.

9. The Unity.

A powerful army of Super Mutants that was established by the immensely powerful unique Super Mutant known as The Master, the Unity is an incredibly strong entity that once posed an existential threat to the entire human race at the absolute zenith of their power. Having exclusive access to all manner of high-end top-notch weapons (i.e. 5.56 x .45mm NATO Light Machine Guns, 5mm Miniguns and Heavy Incinerators) and having genetically modified super soldiers with hardened flesh and bone that could easily provide superb protection against gunfire, blunt trauma and cuts as well as highly enhanced degrees of speed, strength, stamina, endurance and intelligence (though most Unity soldiers were admittedly idiots), the Unity is indeed a force to be reckoned with.

However, the Unity was only such a threat back in Fallout 1 due to the lack of civilization and any form of organized entity that could effectively challenge it. With only several dozen troops at best at its disposal even at the absolute height of their reign of terror, any of the above factions could very easily defeat them. Which is why they are so low on the list.

8. The West Coast Chapters of the Brotherhood of Steel under High Elder Rhombus.

Under the wise guidance and brilliant leadership of High Elder Rhombus, the West Coast Chapters of the Brotherhood of Steel easily enjoyed a golden age without question. They enjoyed vast amounts of influence, played an immensely invaluable role in both the pacification of the West Coast and the rise of the NCR and were most certainly irreplaceable components to the rejuvenation of civilization in the Wastelands as a whole. 

Combined with the fact that they also had several hundred troops that were fully-equipped with only the latest in firepower (having virtually unlimited access to all manner of highly-sophisticated state-of-the-art Energy Weapons) and protection (ranging from highly-superb Recon Armor for Knights to state-of-the-art T-51b Power Armor for Paladins), the West Coast Chapters of the Brotherhood of Steel are without a doubt one of the powerful factions in Fallout history. Of course, history also tells us that this ultimately wasn't anywhere near enough to save them. The NCR-Brotherhood War perfectly demonstrated this by seeing them brought to the brink of total extinction by the NCR. Meaning that any of the above factions can also defeat them, as well.

7. The Midwestern Chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel.

An immensely powerful faction with bunkers, towns, settlements and communities spanning from Chicago to Denver, the Midwestern Chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel has most certainly more than earned its spot on this list. Fielding a magnificently strong force that consists of Super Mutants, Sentient Deathclaws, Ghouls and even the robotic soldiers of the Calculator's Army alongside normal Humans, the Midwestern Chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel could easily field an army of several hundred warriors.

Combined with the fact that its army is also very well-equipped with all manner of high-end conventional firearms, high-grade explosives, state-of-the-art Energy Weapons and their own unique variants of highly-protective Power Armor as well as at least 1 WWII-era M-4 Sherman Medium Battle Tank and a small fleet of Armored Personnel Carriers, Humvees and light scout vehicles, the Midwestern Chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel is indeed a force to be reckoned with. However, its relatively small size in addition to the fact that the above factions have their own technological advantages that could all but offset its own technologies means that it sits at lucky number 7.

6. The Eastern Division (Fallout 4).

Since the rise of Arthur Maxson as Supreme Commander of the Brotherhood of Steel, the once weak and feeble moribund handful of nobodies formally known as Lyons' Brotherhood of Steel has evolved to become what is easily not only the most powerful part of the ENTIRE Brotherhood of Steel, but also the absolute most dominant force on the whole of the Eastern Seaboard now known as the Eastern Division.

With an entire armada of VB-01 Vertibirds that are outfitted with light armor and armed with front-mounted Machine Gun pods as well as door-mounted 5mm Miniguns, a massive 40,000-ton airship known as the Prydwen that enables power projection across the entire Eastern Seaboard, an army of hundreds of well-trained, well-equipped, highly-experienced professional soldiers that are exclusively equipped with all manner of high-quality conventional firearms, state-of-the-art Energy Weapons and highly-sophisticated Power Armor (all Brotherhood combat troops are fully-equipped with standard-issued T-60 Power Armor and just about any Energy Weapon imaginable, for instance) and (best of all) the means to MANUFACTURE all of its VB-01 Vertibirds, weapons and Power Armor, the Eastern Division is easily and without a doubt more than worthy of its position on this list.

And now for the creme de la resistance: Liberty Prime Mk.II, a giant laser-shooting nuke-tossing nigh-invincible combat robot that's been kicking Communist ass and dishing out freedom and democracy since 2277. A war machine that's more than proven itself capable of absolutely massacring even the likes of the Enclave with relative ease in battle many times over and has also proven to be all but impossible to destroy absent nuclear weapons or overwhelming conventional firepower in the form of the Bradley-Hercules Orbital Strike Array. Alas, as with the other factions beneath them, their utter lack of numbers ultimately screws them over in the long run. As does the fact that the above factions have plenty of advanced technologies of their own to even the odds.

5. The Boomers.

A highly xenophobic, massively isolationist yet highly-advanced culture wielding spectacular amounts of firepower, the Boomers are indeed a force to be reckoned with. Despite being massively outnumbered by the world outside the walls of the Nellis homeland, they've more than offset their numerical disadvantage with overwhelming firepower in the form of multiple Pre-War howitzers with ranges that easily span across much of the Mojave Wasteland and enough firepower to utterly obliterate ANYTHING (including Brotherhood Paladins clad in T-51b Power Armor) that they strike in addition to a Pre-War WWII-era B-29 Superfortress Strategic Bomber that grants the Boomers the power to strike ANYWHERE across all of the Wastes with enough firepower to devastate ENTIRE ARMIES in relative in-flight safety.

To further bolster their already-impregnable defensive perimeter of artillery and bombs, the Boomers also have exclusive access to all manner of high-end, high-grade explosives (ranging from 40mm Grenade Rifles, 25mm Grenade Launchers and 25mm Grenade Machine Guns to Missile Launchers and Fat Man Tactical Nuke Launchers) that are STANDARD-ISSUED across all of their members in addition to state-of-the-art conventional firearms (i.e. 5.56 x .45mm Marksman Carbines and 5mm Assault Carbines) and combat robots ranging from Mister Gutsy combat robots to Sentry Bots.

Everyone from children all the way up to the elderly are constantly trained and conditioned in order to become proper soldiers that can preserve the Nellis homeland not to mention that everybody also receives a full highly-advanced education, as well. The Nellis homeland is also entirely self-sufficient, with its very own agricultural centers, its own highly-sophisticated infrastructure, its own solar panel array for both electricity and 100% energy independence, fresh water that's drawn straight from Lake Mead and even their own industrial capacity which enables them to manufacture all of their own weapons and munitions. Therefore, they've more than earned their spot in the Top 5, accordingly.

4. The Enclave (Fallout 3).

Formed from the few survivors of the wrath of the Chosen One as well as the destruction of Control Station E.N.C.L.A.V.E., the Fallout 3 Enclave has still proven to be incredibly powerful and extremely deadly in its own right despite its humble origins. Despite its severe deficiency in numbers (only having at best a couple hundred troops at its disposal), the Fallout 3 Enclave more than compensates for it with an armada of HUNDREDS of VB-02 Vertibirds that are outfitted with heavy armor and armed with Gatling Lasers, Missile Launcher racks and Mini Nuke Launchers, an army of all manner of combat robots, their human forces being fully-equipped with all manner of highly-sophisticated state-of-the-art Energy Weapons and top-notch Power Armor (the Mk.II Advanced Power Armor and the Hellfire Power Armor, both of which are leagues more advanced than the previous Mk.I Advanced Power Armor, which was strong enough to shrug off anything less than a direct hit from a PLASMA CASTER) and the means to MASS-PRODUCE all of the above.

There's also yet another technological marvel that also grants the Fallout 3 Enclave an immense edge over all of the other factions beneath it: the Bradley-Hercules Orbital Strike Array, a weapon with enough conventional firepower to effortlessly obliterate even the likes of Liberty Prime without even the slightest effort. Operating out of their strongholds within the confines of Raven's Rock, Adams Air Force Base and the Enclave Mobile Base Crawler under the dual leadership of President John Henry Eden and Colonel August Autumn, the Fallout 3 Enclave is truly an entity that's not to be trifled with.

However, their strengths are also offset by their weaknesses. Those weaknesses being lack of numbers (combat robots are absolutely vital to their ranks as a direct result of this) and lack of any unified command (it's no secret that President Eden and Colonel Autumn are so divided in their methods of leadership that the Fallout 3 Enclave literally erupts into full-blown civil war, but I digress). Weaknesses that ultimately serve to handicap their potential and land them at #4 on the list.

3. The New California Republic.

An immensely colossal nation with an enormously gargantuan population of MILLIONS of citizens (2.5 million, by my estimates) and vastly huge territory and influence that spans across all of California, all of Oregon, all of the Baja Peninsula, all of Nevada and even as far East as Utah and Arizona (Bullhead City and all of its surrounding areas, to be more specific), the New California Republic is easily and without a single doubt the absolute largest, most powerful, most dominant, most influential, wealthiest entity in the entirety of the post-apocalyptic world, today.

A nation that also just happens to be in possession of the absolute largest, most powerful, most dominant military force in all of the Wastes what with HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of troops (150,000 in active service, 350,000 in reserve, by my estimates), an insanely colossal amount of firepower (all soldiers within the Republic military have exclusive access to and are fully-equipped with all manner of high-end top-notch conventional firearms, high-grade explosives and even highly-sophisticated state-of-the-art Energy Weapons in the case of elite forces) and a superbly titanic technological edge (the Republic military also just happens to be in possession of a fleet of several dozen VB-02 Vertibirds that are outfitted with heavy armor and heavily-armed to the teeth with Gatling Lasers, Missile Launcher racks and Mini Nuke Launchers, sophisticated computer software that assists with the command, control, coordination, communications and evaluation of Republic forces, satellite/radio communications that can offer real-time coordination of Republic military operations, Global Positioning System satellites, an entire mechanized division consisting of Jeeps and trucks for logistics in addition to even several salvaged Combat Armored Personnel Carriers and tanks, quite a few salvaged AA Guns as well as even a few Fixed-Wing Aircraft (though it isn't known if they're operational, yet)).

The NCR Armed Forces have proven to be extremely powerful, immensely dangerous adversaries to even the most technologically-advanced of factions due to its overwhelmingly insurmountable edge in manpower as well as the ludicrously insane degrees of firepower and the superbly innate technological sophistication of their forces. More than proving this by crushing the West Coast Chapters of the Brotherhood of Steel and driving them to the brink of extinction during the NCR-Brotherhood War, smashing the Mojave Chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel in the glorious triumph that was Operation: Sunburst (the Battle of HELIOS One) and finishing off the shattered survivors of the Enclave during the Sacking of Navarro. With such magnificently indomitable military might at their disposal, the NCR is quite frankly all but impossible to defeat entirely in a total war by all but 2 factions (more on them, soon).

Of course, the NCR's immense power and influence don't just stem from military might alone. The NCR also just happens to be in possession of the absolute largest, most dominant, most powerful economy in all of the Wastes, vastly infinite wealth that effectively makes the NCR the absolute most indomitable, most powerful, most influential financial superpower in existence, the absolute finest, most sophisticated, most state-of-the-art, most cutting-edge, most highly-advanced healthcare in the entirety of the post-apocalyptic world (the annexation of Vault City alone granted the NCR virtually unlimited access to organ cloning technology, performance enhancement implant technology, armor grafting technology and Auto-Doc technology amongst innumerable other highly-advanced medical technologies not to mention the ability to mass-produce the aforementioned technologies along with stims, superstims, Rad-X, RadAway and other modern medicines, as well), the absolute finest, greatest, most grand, most sophisticated infrastructure in the whole of the Wastelands (the NCR is absolutely bursting at the seams with forts, military bases, military outposts, schools, hospitals, roads, railroads, factories, weapons foundries, etc. etc.), a monstrously mammoth industrial/manufacturing capacity that makes it the single greatest industrial superpower on Earth and an enormously titanic agricultural output that easily places the NCR as the agronomical powerhouse of the post-apocalyptic world.

Either way, the NCR is more than worthy of its position on the list.

2. The Enclave (Fallout 2).

An enormously powerful organization of titanic strength and influence that claims to be the rightful masters of Post-War America, the original Enclave has virtually no equal. Despite its relatively small size as an entity, the Enclave has a vast wealth of technological secrets and innovations that more than makes up for its size. In command of a relatively large army of extremely well-trained, well-conditioned, well-equipped, highly-experienced professional warriors that is exclusively massively armed to the teeth with all manner of high-end conventional firearms, high-grade explosives and state-of-the-art Energy Weapons as well as the dreaded Mk.I Advanced Power Armor (all of which is STANDARD-ISSUED), a vastly endless armada of VB-02 Vertibirds and the means to MASS-PRODUCE all of the above, the Enclave truly has no rival.

Of course, the Enclave has a Royal Flush in the form of 3 completely insurmountable advantages. The first being Frank Horrigan, a unique Super Mutant warrior of the Enclave who's easily and without a single doubt the absolute greatest warrior in the history of the post-apocalyptic world. His genetic mutations caused by exposure to F.E.V. being further augmented with both Enclave genetic modifications and his encasement into a special suit of Power Armor that constantly injects Stims, Superstims and chems into his bloodstream, has built-in energy blades and Plasma Cannons and is all but impervious to only the absolute most powerful of Energy Weapons, Frank Horrigan is a truly unstoppable force of nature that can literally laugh off multiple direct hits from a PLASMA CASTER without breaking a sweat and tear Deathclaws apart with nothing but his BARE HANDS. Such a God-like asset surely grants the Enclave an immense edge over its opponents.

Their second advantage is in the form of the nuclear missile silos of the Divide. As the nuclear football that ultimately caused the Divide Incident came from Navarro, it can be safely assumed that the Enclave was in possession of it before the events of Fallout 2. Meaning that such weapons of apocalyptic power can indeed be used by the Enclave anytime that it deems it necessary to do so. The third and final advantage of the Enclave lies within F.E.V. Curling-13. A heavily-modified biochemical weapon of mass destruction with the power to exterminate ALL IRRADIATED LIFE ON EARTH (anybody that isn't in the Enclave or a Vault Dweller dies instantaneously). When combined, all 3 advantages go on to make the Enclave completely invincible. Under the single unified command of President Dick Richardson, the Enclave has no challenger or equal that can survive against it. All but one..........

1. The Think Tank.

""In the decades following the Battle of Hoover Dam, the Big Empty remained a desolate stretch of wasteland, where few travelers dared venture.

{Curious, this is odd...}In time, however, a strange blue field began to grow, slowly spreading across the Big Empty.

Lightning-blue fields of force danced on the horizon, like electrical storms.

People whispered of ""floating spheres,"" flickering like a rainbow of torches in the desert like Old World wisps.

{Cold, curiosity changes to doom}Then communities began to vanish.

Goodsprings was crushed beneath bizarre hexcrete blocks that stacked to the sky. The inhabitants of Primm winked out, flesh-fried into X-ray silhouettes, their arms raised in surrender.

A satellite fell on Jacobstown, beaming a kaleidoscope of bright blue equations into the deranged Nightkin minds, driving some berserk, paralyzing others.

Black Mountain Radio began broadcasting a strange staccato static as hordes of giant man-eating battle brahmin began to swarm from its peak.

Camp Searchlight became a garden of giant carnivorous plants, and the Colorado river... ""shrugged"" one day, drowning several communities as its contours adjusted themselves.

The Gomorrah became home to a particularly virulent vegetation-based STD that grew like a fungus within victim's genitalia until their bodies burst open like pods.

The Legion East were systematically brain-scrubbed and rebuilt so that all the inhabitants believed they were in ancient Rome... on the moon.

...and the human cattle of NCR were re-educated into believing they existed in perpetuity in a nation-wide version of someplace called ""Tranquility Lane.""

In the end, no one was sure who had cracked the Dome of the Big Empty, although it was clear someone had been playing with forces they did not understand.

Throughout all this, the Think Tank was industrious, confident these experiments were all for the best, the results of the data they obtained - incredible.

They marveled that {emph}all of this had been waiting for them to come along and experiment since the war.

{Knowingly}Humanity certainly was persistent, no matter what experiments, nuclear holocaust or otherwise, it inflicted on itself.""

This cut ending for the Old World Blues DLC speaks for itself. The Think Tank is the absolute most powerful faction in all of the Fallout Universe. And that's a wrap. A penny for your thoughts?

I know it happens in real life, as my family had this happen in world war 2. My great grandma used to own a Campbell’s soup factory. When the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, the military converted lots of factories to produce military equipment instead of civilian products. My great grandma’s factory was part of that: instead of making soup, they were to produce steel objects: artillery shells, bullets, helmets, that sort of thing. It was converted back after the war, and since that time that particular factory has since closed its doors, but it still happens to be a common practice.

On the same note, it looks like slocum’s joes did something similar with the switchboard. Admittedly, that was more cia than anything, but it may also have roots in the Star Wars program of Ronald Reagan. Don’t quote on any of that though, that’s just my speculation.

I personally support it within ethical boundaries, not like west-tek, but still, what are you guys thoughts on this?

1612,A interesting discovery I had about the Factions of Fallout 4 and most Factions of the Wasteland,1600060515,"So, I was scrolling around Reddit as you do, when I saw this post on Gaming Circle Jerk: [ A Funny joke about how Liberty Prime, while beloved by the fandom as one of the most famous scenes in any of the Fallout games, has a fandom of people who tend to for reasons I never understood take what he says literally. Which is odd, since he has always been an abject parody of people who love saying this like, ""ANYONE LEFT OF REGAIN IS A DIRTY COMII!"", and lovingly points out the fact by stating how the only people Liberty Prime ever killed where: The Enclave and the Institute, both having claims to be inheritors of the mantle of the USA. It has, never unless proven otherwise, killed ANYONE he was designed to go against be it communist aligned or Chinese.

Beyond that, later down in the comments down a way's I got this gem of an idea that really changed my view of what Fallout 4 is really about. Enter user, briloci: 

""Its not agreeing with it but you are right that its not criticizing capitalism

In general Fallout 4 makes a question about the identity of the US identity and every faction represents a side of its identity with the Minutemen representing the original revolutionary ideals of democracy and peace, the Brotherhood of Steel representing its military and imperialism, the Railroad its liberal struggles for liberation (mostly black liberation with the influences to the civil war and John Brown) and the Institute to its technological and scientific development

So in the game you can decide which one of this elements are more important and try to help them survive""

  
This, in a way, finally clicked in my mind why I am one of a few people who really love the Factional lore in Fallout 4. Namely the historical propitiaty Bethesda took with the major players in Boston: Notably how the Brotherhood's Arrival is almost Parade like speaking to the glory days of American parades after wartime, how the Minutemen both take their name and their goals after the Minutemen who fought in the early days of the American Revolutionary War to ""Protect the Settlement on your map"", The Railroad is even named after the first part of (and designs itself as a effective continuation of) the Underground Railroad and heavily prides itself in being the Liberators of the Synths and the counterweight to the Institute, and speaking of which the Institute itself is fundamentally a continuation of America's obsession with advancing technology in the years post-WW2 and even to today.

For that matter, all of the major Factions are DELIBERATELY flawed, sometimes to levels of comedy: 

The Brotherhood of Fallout 4 is now of a full belief that in addition to its obsession with tech it is also is a fully Jingoistic organization and even (debatable if you view Synths as a 'Race' or something entirely different) racism as well as having a weirdly psudoscientific entrance exam with while not DIRECTLY against any one belief or another, seems to on the nose to be not without a single meaning: [ The Minutemen too are a, shall we say, less then amazing organization especially when you bump into them first no? Your meeting with Preston Garvy has him effectively fighting against a small army of raiders himself while the rest of the Minutemen are either wounded, not trained for combat, or...Mama Murphy, which is kinda both? It could both represent the fact that while militias exist they come off today as strangely larpy in nature nowadays and rarely influence much besides helping sell weapons: [ The Railroad is, well, you can call it a lot of things actually. ""PC Police"", ""Woke Anarchists"", or hell even the old joke of ""White guys who think X race is inferior and thus should be 'saved'"". Though really, I believe it mostly stands for a counter arguement against the idea of totally falling for left wing ideals (or just racialist ones, or hell, even far left ones). For it comes off as Urbanial as drinking and shooting guns is the wild is viewed as 'Hickish'. 

Also, there is the whole thing with P. A. M. , which, if any of the conspiracy theories is true about her...dear god she might single handily be the most important lore point in the Fallout series PERIOD, and also is just about the most terrifying AI in the fallout universe.

Finally is the Institute, an organization that works to advance science but also does it in a way that make collectively make anyone who worked on a science safety board cry. In addition to coming off less like a unitary body of scientists and more like the Homeowners Association, it also suffers from the same issues as HA. Inadvertently racist due to being xenophobic of outsiders, having treated local 'minorities' like second class citizens and not prioritizing their development (and even, again debatively depending on your view on the matter, treating like a Segregated people or even slaves) , and generally making everyone paranoid they aren't fitting into society.

&amp;#x200B;

So, with that said my conclusion to all this is thus; Fallout 4 is a game directly about politics in society, and how society truly handles itself and makes enemies and friends along the way. Its biggest examples are how society handles 'race relations', paranoia, religion, and even thought. But most of all, how ""Nate"" or his wife reacts to the world around him / her. Because, well, going back on the Gaming Circle Jerk thread above, you can disagree with what it says above or agree with what it says. 

You can't however, not take a side.

1617,Huge Xbox One modded playthrough,1600053153,"Ok so I decided to try out fallout 4 again this time with mods. This will be my second time in general first with mods. I’ve downloaded over 90 mods and I know 90 is a lot for Xbox. It seems fine so far I’ve gone to Concord and Diamond City making sure everything is fine and it wouldn’t explode. I’m going to do some more testing.

I wanted to make this alittle bit of everything for everyone. It kind just overhauls almost everything from factions armors, to weapons that will be put into the leveled lists, to gameplay ai overhauls to make it more difficult, settlement building, etc...

I’m going to do a play though and post it on YouTube and I want to make it as enjoyable for everyone as possible. So my question is should I delete and download bigger mods so you guys don’t have to download 90+ mods if you want to play along with me. Granted not all of them you need to download but like what do you guys want?

General mods that if you want to play with me this should give you somewhat same experience

NAC Natural &amp; Atmospheric Commonwealth - By L00pin

Arbitration - A Gameplay Overhaul - By Jackarbiter Immersive Fallout - By zanadaniel

Reverb and Ambiance overhaul - By mm135 radBirds - Birds Sound Overhaul - By steve40 P.A.M.S. Power Armor Movement Sounds - By ONIXer Project Reality Footsteps FO4 - By HULKHOLD3N

Borealis Landscape - By Napoleonofthestump Indubitable Ivy - By Spiffyskytrooper Boston Natural Surroundings - By Silverfox600

If you download Boston Natural Surroundings DONT download the Borealis LOD. Borealis and Boston Natural Surroundings is fine but don’t download the LOD it will cause lag issues in your game especially at Concord when the death claw comes out.

Survival Options - By Jekod Immersive HUD (iHUD) - By Gopher

These mods will probably bring the most change and the rest unless I’m forgetting some either enhance or add on to the game

I have gory mods like Live dismemberment By DeathclawAlpha, Enhanced blood textures basic By dDefinder, and more

Eli’s Armour Compendium By Elianora, synth overhaul C.A.S.T. By MaaroTakao, and B-35C Heavy BoS By xgamer468

Modular Kalash By DOOMBASED, the pipe shotgun collection By elgoes, beretta By fadingsignal, and more

Lots more male hairstyles By rbddc12, lots more beards and moustaches By rbddc12,

Gorgeous Eyes overhaul By ShroudLegacy To my knowledge Xbox only so for

PC The Eyes of beauty Fallout Edition By LogRaam

PS4 Eyes Expanded By Lamanise

One last thing be careful with Eye mods if you have a modded eye color on your character and you delete the mod it will mess up your character.

Campsite (XBOX) - Simple Wasteland Camping By fadingsignal, The Mobile Mechanic XBOX ONE - Portable By fadingsignal, and Conquest - Building New Settlements And Camping By Chesko

I think you get the point right?

So again I don’t mind going through reevaluating some of the mods and lowering the amount I have but I will look for replacements that are bigger so there aren’t as many. Meaning 90 mods to download lol.

I really want this to be an enjoyable experience for everyone who wants to join me. I’ll also try to look into some replacement ps4 mods but you’re very limited so not sure how much I’ll be able to help. Especially because I can’t test the compatibility I can only suggest mods.

I’ll post the final mod list and load order once it’s finished. If I do delete any mods and download any others I gotta make sure it won’t crash the game, but I’m only doing so much because I also don’t want to spoil to much for myself.

(Fallout 3 base game and dlc spoilers).,1600049877,"It’s been about twelve years since we all first ventured into the unforgiving capital wasteland. The natural sun blinding us as we first stepped out of vault 101. A scorched, bleak landscape stretched out in every direction. With many questions and few answers we strode forward. 

It has been twelve years since that fateful day. The footprints I first left have been covered over by dust, time, and death. So I once again left the vault. With nostalgia in my heart I sought  new horizons. 

About a week ago I started playing fallout 3 on the Xbox one (backwards compatibility rocks). I originally played on the pc when I got it on day one. Back then I knew nothing of Bethesda beyond my adventures in oblivion and a brief glimpse into the foreign land of Morrowind. My return visit to the wasteland opened more doors. I bought the expansions I longed for all those years ago. I’ve set foot in irradiated swamps of point lookout, the steel mill of the Pitt, the glimpse into the old world in operation anchorage, and I’ve slain my alien captors on the mothership. It is such a wonder to return to such a nostalgic landscape to find new experiences. Soon I shall continue the fight against the enclave in broken steel. So much waits to be uncovered in the wasteland. With my trusty suit of power armor, a laser rifle, and a handful of micro fusion cells I shall stride ever forward.

October 23rd, 4004BCE, 9am

Of course we know this is the date of the Great War. That and we know all the clocks on the east coast are stuck at 9:47. 

What could this mean? It could be a nod by the creators of the original games to this Biblical chronology, the 9am part maybe added by Bethesda in Fallout 3. This could be poetic as the end of the world occurred at the same day as its creation. Or this could mean the post/war world of Fallout began on the infamous creation day of the Bible.

1687,Possible realistic ending in Fallout 4,1599985156,"After playing with all factions I came to realise that there should be a realistic ending in Fallout 4. Not canonical ending but realistic.

I never sided with the Institute untill now. I never spend enough time in the Institute in my previous playthroughs (never did a quest for them). And I decided to do an Institute playthrough and I realised how wrong I was before. The Institute has everything the Sole Survivor would need and it's the closest to his/her past life. Clean food, clean rooms, clean toilets, items in pristine condition. Now it looks like a great hospital, but it's the closest to pre war the Sole Survivor was used to.

Also one other thing is that every parent wants to see their child be succesfull and the Father is more successfull than you expect. He is the head scientist in the biggest scientific Instalment in known Fallout world. His knowledge is far beyond every scientists. He even shrvived frozen as a baby unprotected in cryo stasis.

And before someone says anything about morals etc think of this. How many times real life scientists and doctors went out of the way? When covid-19 started to spread in the world some doctors wanted to inject the virus to some people just to see how they react and if it will lead them to vaccines. Sure the Institutes morals and more questionable, but since we've seen that Synths are made even without killing the people you want to replace, Art vs Art encounter, Tektus in Far Harbor, I'm pretty sure there are more but I can't think anyone else right now. So you can replace someone without killing them. Also, In Robotis Lab in Institute you see how Synths are made, so they don't necessarily replace others.

I'm not saying it's the best faction. Far from it. I'm saying that realistically the Sole Survivor, whether it's Nate or Nora, would join the Institute because it's clean and reminds them of the pre war era. Also their son is in charge so they have extra priviledges, even if they weren't the director.

1714,Question For Fan Developers,1599949671,"Hi, Fallout Fans and Devs. I am a university student majoring in Film (Director, Writer, Producer) and minoring in Animation (pre-production) who recently created a Fallout Spinoff concept for a dramatic action story that I feel is best to be developed into a 2D RPG game rather than other formats. However, I was never interested in computer coding because I am more of a literature creative person, and I honestly don't know where should I start with developing this 2D RPG game into a playable demo (I've heard mixed things about RPG Maker MZ, currently exploring Unity without coding experience).

This is my basic question, but I will provide a lot more further context below for anyone interested.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Context**:

**What this game is about**:

The game is an unofficial spin-off story to the Fallout franchise (similar to FO New California). I believe the potential created in the Fallout series is massive that rivals famous RPGs like World of Warcraft and Warhammer. However, since Bethesda Studio now has a gameplay-first, profit-first approach to Fallout Franchise, the narrative potential for the franchise incredibly underdeveloped.

My concept tells the story of a ranger type character in 2203 American Wasteland. Whom upon being hired by Encalve at Navarro goes onto an adventure to deliver a secretive package from California to Raven Rocks at Washington DC. It is basically a road-trip adventure type story that is similar to how adventure stories are structured. So from a fundamental point, my vision for the story can be easily translated to the 2D Japanese RPG framework.

**How will it looks like**:

I grew up reading Manga, so the visual style will be very close to the Japanese anime/JRPG style. Even though the Fallout franchise is traditionally Western, I believe Anime style would only benefit the overall presentation.

**Why JRPG**:

It is mainly a stylistic choice, plus there are a lot of similarities to Fallout 1 &amp; 2 and JRPG games. Fundamentally, they both have stats based strategy system, text-based dialogue system, and most gameplays are 2D. I have zero experience in coding so develop a ground-up 2D RPG game will be impossible, while JRPG already has a very mature and developed gameplay framework.

I’ve attempted this once before. I was set. I died. It’s all on YouTube. To keep it legit, I kept everything in. I did  minor editing. I edited the audio, nothing else.

It made long, and boring episodes. Some people liked it. I want to do it again. I am going to do it differently. 

This time, I am going to edit the videos. I’ll remove everything that is boring. Survival entices a lot of walking. 

I ask a few people. They said you can look in your stats - to prove you didn’t die. I haven’t tested that - yet. If you think I am going to lie - and keep playing after a death, this series isn’t for you. It’s hard to balance entertaining content and real content. If I die, that’s the end of the series - but you only have my word for that. 

The videos (on average) were around forty minutes long. This time around, a forty minute video should give me eight minutes worth of entertaining content. Game wise, that is. No one wants to watch me scrap everything in Sanctuary.

1749,Why are the most important resources and scrap the rarest find?,1599921965,"Might go on a bit of a rant here, so bare with me. It's likely gonna be a long one. TL;DR at the bottom.

One of my favorite things that Fallout 4 did well, was it's modifications, but there is also a few things about it that are completely asinine.

Namely the whole resource and scrap mechanic. Now on paper, it's works Just fine. I want to add a suppressor to my pistol, well I just need 2 steel, 2 adhesive, 3 screws, and a spring.

However, in practice it couldn't be any more impractical. 2 steel you can find pretty much anywhere, and springs select few products, but if you think that tube of wonder glue is gonna work for the adhesive you'd be wrong. Same goes for screws.

Now I can understand to an extent some resources, like adhesive can be quite rare. But take a look around your house, and maybe even your desk. Just at a glance, how many of your items have screws in them? At my desk alone, I counted 17. All of various sizes. 

While you can argue ""Oh it's post apocalyptic, and different setting so therefore screws might not be as common."" and to that, I disagree.

I'm willing to bet, even a vast majority of the items out there would likely have screws in them, and aren't made up of, or contain the items listed in the junk pile. 

My biggest gripe is if you're going to have a modification or crafting system in your game, then the rarity of the resource needs to match the rarity of the item your trying to craft. If adhesive is such a rare find, why is it used in almost all the different modifications? Same goes for screws. Why are the two rarest resources, used in every mod?

That means, if an mod needs 4 adhesive, you have 3, you end up running all across the wasteland looking for some wonder glue, duct tape, or vegetable starch. And with screws you end up dropping that rocket launcher or fatman you were carrying in case a Deathclaw decides to play peek-a-boo with your asshole so you can carry more typewriters, hot plates, and desk fans.

While the Scrapper perk alleviates this problem just a tad, this pretty much becomes essential in any build because of how much you'll likely be modding throughout the game, and don't want to spend a lot of time walking around looking for screws.

Not to mention, some of these mods are sometimes just straight up essential for surviving harder difficulties, or just making the game tolerable as is. Especially if it's the receiver mods. What baffles me is not only the resources required to make a mod, but also the level cap. Why do I need to wait until I'm level 13 to slap a suppressor on my pistol when I already have the resources for it? Why do I need to be level 25 for a whole 5 more damage on that same pistol? If I already meet the prerequisites, in terms of resources, then there really isn't need for a level cap.

While I can understand a level cap being there for ""balance"" at the same time, by that level, it's extremely likely that I will have already found a better weapon, or mod to replace, giving me no incentive to actually use it. 

It just doesn't make sense from a design perspective, and gameplay perspective. Look at any other type of survival crafting game. Like Minecraft, for example. Diamonds are probably one of the rarest resources and crafting material in the game, next to emeralds. When you find diamonds, it feels good, and it feels like you made some actual progress and the items you get from it, are some of the best in the game. Iron isn't particularly rare, but when you do find a good vein or abundance of it you still have a reputable amount of protection and resources and can make a lot of good things with it.

In Fallout 4, there's no cathartic progression, it feels like you're going from one roadblock to another. And trying to find those ""rare"" resources becomes a tedious grind, scouring Boston for that one piece of duct tape, or hot plate you overlooked.

I can already think of better ways to implement this crafting system and make it more enjoyable. For example, add a perk called ""Budget cuts"" which allows you reduce the number of resources needed for crafting. Also add ""Budget"" mods or ""Scrap"" mods. These could be cheaper alternatives, if you lack the resources needed to create the mod. A scrap suppressor might not make the weapon totally suppressed, but does give you a lower chance at being detected. A scrap scope might not be that high in terms of magnification, but offers you decent alternative if you can't afford the higher end parts to make a functioning scope.

You could also have varying types of resources. For example, with screws, you could have large, medium and small screws. large screws go with a lot of different mods or weapons, medium for slightly more complex devices, and small screws being the rarest for the most intricate series of tinkering. With adhesive, you can have strong adhesive and weak adhesive. Weak for small changes, or bare minimum gluing, and strong adhesive for a lot of gluing or sticking together.

However, like with a lot of Fallout 4, there were some good ideas, but they ended up getting buried underneath my collection of typewriters that I got from the ruins of Bethesda Game Studios.

**TL;DR:** The crafting system sucks by making the ""Rarest"" resources being used in nearly every mod, and doesn't have the same sense of progression as other survival crafting games. If they had added more depth or changed things around, it would have been really great, but is disappointing much like all of Fallout 4.",Fallout,DexxToress,False,/r/Fallout/comments/irdus5/why_are_the_most_important_resources_and_scrap/,1

FO3: The Replicated Man quest is pretty much a direct reference to the replicants.

FO3: Fawkes says ""Wake up, time to die!"" during the quest Finding the Garden of Eden.

NV: That Gun is almost identical to Deckard's gun.

NV: The gun runners challenge ""Benefit or A Hazard"" is taken from the line ""Replicants are like any other machine, they're either a benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.""

FO4: The roof top of the Mass Fusion Containment Shed depicts the ""Tears in rain"" scene.

FO4: Takahashi who runs the noodle bar has only one line in the game which is the exact same phrase used by the guy at the noodle bar in blade runner.

So this is a well-known glitch, but i did some research on Google, and I can't find a fix for xbox one. There is a supply line between taffington and sunlight drive in on my map, but no caravan to be found. If anyone knows how to fix this, or knows whether it affects anything or not, please let me know!
Context:
- you can see the caravan on the population manager system, and i do not have any caravans. I even removed every settler from their job to be sure.
- there is a glitch where if you teleport into the settlement in the middle of the night (or sleep until then) and hit the bell, the caravan will turn around and you can locate them much faster.  You might get lucky and find them sleeping or at the exit. I find it works more often at night. You can also run down the street if they've gone too far, but I'm not sure how you'd re-assign them because i only use this other method of mine, and it always works for me. If it doesnt work the first time, i usually just try again. 


I used both of these methods and can't find a single person to account for this supply line, so i think its the glitch thats pretty common. I even went so far as to travel between to make sure, and theres no one. Im not using any mods right now. I did at one point but i stopped. Like i said, if you know a fix or any info please comment!

1808,Some of my loose ideas for an OG Fallout/New Vegas TV show,1599861827,"[LONG POST AHEAD] [POSSIBLE SPOILERS] 

Well, I've been daydreaming of an OG Fallout/New Vegas live action, but i hardly see Bethesda giving rights to it, so here I share with You some loose ideas of how I would do it if I was the showrunner and had a massive budget. 

It would be a New Vegas Adaptation with some OG Fallout and Fallout 2 flashbacks and references. The main characters would be the Courier, Cass, Veronica, Arcade, Boone and Raúl; Each one having their story arc.

The Courier would be striked by Benny and saved at Goodsprings, then he would follow on sticking to the game's story untill he reached New Vegas, striked Benny back and became Mr. House's right hand. He would do all the in-game missions and then be sent to Utah by Mr. House seeking for Joshua Graham for aid and advice against Caesar and would help him and the Dead Horses fight off the White Legs. Then, before Hoover Dam, he would be contacted by Ulysses and pretty much do the same as in Lonesome Road, just  Instead of the nukes, Ulysses would threathen to invade the Mojave with the Marked Men (That wouldn't be ghouls, just NCR/Legion survivors under Ulysses Command). The Courier would try to convince him to join, but Ulysses would say that if he bested him at combat he would leave the Marked Men under his command to prove he was a worthy force of change. He would kill Ulysses and return to the Mojave realizing Mr. House, the Legion and NCR were just remnants of a dead past and would aim to drive them off to create something new. With the help of Dr. Emily Ortal he would hack Mr. House and seize control of New Vegas and the Securitron Army (No Yes Man this time). After that, with the help of the Boomers, Khans and the following mentioned factions he would relieve the loosing NCR at Hoover Dam, Defeat Legion and then seize control of the Mojave. He would kick the NCR out of the Mojave and throw General Oliver off Hoover Dam. 

Cass would have a much simpler arc, but no less interesting. She, after meeting the courier, would sell her franchise to Crimson Caravan and start investigating what happened to her outfit. She would realize it was the CC and the Van Graffs after being captured by Gloria to be killed. She would escape and tell the Gun Runners the plan to sabotage them. They would make a deal to strike back and seize the caravan/weapons market for themselves and supply the Courier's army. At the end, they would kill all the Crimson Caravan and Van Graffs just to realize they had made a deal to supply Caesar's Legion. Along the way she would have flashbacks of her family, including John Cassidy leaving them to join the Chosen One. 

Veronica would have a much more sentimental arc. She would meet the courier and ask him about how she should change the Brotherhood of Steel so they could survive. She would start a quest to show them they are obsolete and must open up or fade away. She would not convince them, so she would leave to join the Followers of the Apocalypse and have an affair with Dr. Usanagi. The Brotherhood would strike the Followers and kill everybody just to jail Veronica and she would start a rebellion with the younger ones in which she would win over and become Elder, but with major losses. In the end, she would join Arcade and the Courier to make a difference at Hoover Dam. She would have flashbacks of her and Christine at the Sierra Madre in which she would take the courier's role in Dead Money. 

Arcade would have a Similar journey, he would assemble back the remaining Enclave forces and at the end, he would invite Veronica to make a truce between factions, in which they would dissolve and become a new faction called ""The Old World Guard"" that would join The Courier and The Marked Men at Hoover Dam. Arcade also would have flashbacks of the destruction of Navarro and how de NCR defeated the Enclave.

Boone would investigate Carla's kidnapping with the courier's help same as in game, and would kill Jeanie May. After that, he would follow on his own to kill Severus, Dead Sea and Cannyon Runner, the legionaries that took her that now would be centurions. He would help the NCR liberate their camps untill he reached Bitter Springs, where he would remember the Khan Massacre and lead the stand against Centurion Severus' strike and he would kill him. After that, he would be offered to kill Caesar by Colonel Moore and Chief Hanlon. He would accept it and lead a squad of rangers disguised as legionaries into the fort. They would sucessfully kill Caesar by stabbing him to Death, but then would be overrun by the fort's garrisons, just to be saved by the securitrons awaking underneath. After the Battle, he would find Ranger Ghost among the NCR forces being expelled from the Mojave and would fall in love with Her. 

Last but no least, Raul's arc would be a personal one, half of flashbacks of him after the Great War and half of him trying to find a purpose in his old age. He would be from Ensenada instead of Mexico City and his story with Rafaela (pretty much the same as in game) would develop in Tijuana, The Border and California. He would eventually meet Natalia, Ian, Tycho and Katja (The Vault Dweller and her party from OG Fallout). At the end, he would just join the Courier's Army and die at Hoover Dam.

Some changes I would make and stuff I would Add:

I would reduce the period of the Pre War from 1945-2077 to 1945-1967 so there wouldn't be any technological and social stagnation. The story would then take place arround 2167

Since the Great War occurred in the late 1960's, I would change the aesthetics a bit so they would look less 1950's Sci-Fi and more Cold War-Space age, combined with the Mad Max post-apocalyptic style and some hippie psychedellia.

The Courier Would Drive a Highwayman just like the one the Chosen One used to drive in F2

Old World Blues would be a Pre-War Sci-Fi movie seen by the Courier at the top of the Lucky 38

Instead of the cheesy football wear, the Legionaries would wear actual roman Loricae Segmentate made from scrap metal and pieces of combat armor 

At the same time as Hoover Dam, Joshua Graham on a motorcycle would lead a ""Holy Crusade"" of New Caananites, Dead Horses and Sorrows to take back New Caanan from the Legion


The cast would be:

1815,End of Life Quest Concept,1599853156,"Currently in a play through (first survival, second overall) on FO4. I am currently around level 160. It’s  end game, having destroyed the Institute and Railroad with the BOS, Ad Victoriam. Became the Overboss, and conqurered half the commonwealth, mostly the coastline and the northern borders.

I’ve just been running around opening tribute chests, getting achievements, magazines, Bobbleheads, doing radiant quests of collecting tech and clearing abominations, building settlements, collecting legendary equipment, the usual.

I am pretty overpowered at this point, the game isn’t much of a challenge, I’ve discovered most places, tired of settlement building, and I am desiring something new.

An idea popped into my head. At a time of the player’s choosing, we can begin an end of life quest. As you continue about your game, tending settlements, killing baddies, collecting junk the normal deal, you get randomly ambushed.

Ambushed by and endless, infinite hoard of Deathskull Radscorpions, Mythic Deathclaws, Legendary Mirelurk Queens, Behemoths, Super Mutant Suiciders, Mirelurk Hatchlings, Fog Crawlers, keep coming and don’t stop.

Or maybe you can choose to go out via a horde of Gunner Brigadiers, Assaultron Dominators, and Power Armored Commanders, along with lower leveled enemies of course.

Either way, you pull out all your best weapons and explosives, multiple companions, maybe even a horde of your favorite faction(s) shows up in your defense. In the end, however, you run out of ammo and chems, both you and your companions meet a tragic defeat, ending the playthrough, and you get a nice slideshow of the play through.

In a combat heavy game such as FO4 where the player can be very powerful against the wasteland, this would be quite epic. I haven’t modded FO4 so maybe this exists already as a mod.",Fallout,RiceTongs,False,/r/Fallout/comments/iqxo6i/end_of_life_quest_concept/,1

1819,Why The Master isn't dead after committing suicide. (My Theory),1599850210,"I've come up with an interesting set of theories. The Master being evil, there is no way in hell he would just ""kill"" himself. I put kill in quotes because of one of two reasons. First off, a villain wouldn't just automatically ""kill"" themselves. Theory #1: Telepathic abilities. We know the master has telepathic abilities because as we approach him in fallout 1, we start getting dialogue of the player getting headaches, bloody noses, and weird chills. We later learn that the master has extreme telepathic expertise. So, i´m going to break theory #1 into two ""Sub theories."" Sub - theory #1 of theory #1: The Master could have teleported his mind into Tabitha's, a nightkin super mutant in fallout new vegas. This could be a valid theory because in fnv, Tabitha has a strong sense of bringing the unity or super - mutant army back together. There is only one other person who would do this, which is The Master. Sub - theory #2 of theory #1: A much less interesting theory, The Master is a cyborg mutant thingamajig, so he could have had vast amounts of override data placed in different vaults, most likely placed by his mutants. This could explain why he wants to take over the most vaults that he can, for when he dies, he can teleport all of his knowledge to another terminal or data storage device. Theory #2: Tabitha's secrets. So, in the fallout wiki, it defines Tabitha as a ""former"" member of the Unity. However, The Master is known to have many tricks up his sleeve. Tabitha could have been commanded by The Master to take over if he dies, to continue his reign of absolute terror. This could explain why there are so many super - mutants and nightkin mutants at black mountain. Tabitha wants to reunite everyone from the unity, or just reunite any mutant in general. Completely unrelated to this discussion, this is similar to Arcade Gannon's quest, for Auld Lang Syne, where he brings the remnants of the Enclave back together. Back to Theory #2, Tabitha could very well be a trick of The Master. Now that all that is out of the way, here are some honorable theories: Rhonda (Tabitha's mister handy) could be The Master in a different form, and The Master could of been a remnant of the Enclave, considering his interest in FEV.

The master is clearly an autocrat becoming a dictator, and the mutants are clearly too dumb to realize what the word or action ""Dictator"" means. Evil. After all, the master was the one who released the fev virus on anyone who got in his way, or in this case, anyone he pleased. For example, Lily Bowen from fallout new vegas tells us a heart - chilling story of how the Master **kidnapped her grandkids Jimmy and Becky, and killed them for their souls.

The scraping and settlement building very much add to the wasteland feel, scouting around for anything that can help you and your settlers. The knowledge that you have to be aware of what resources you can scrap from random junk in the wasteland in order to build better guns and lives for your citizens is very interesting gameplay to me. Letting go of a legendary weapon you looted so you can hold more wonderglue is such an absurd concept that reminds me of the absurd world I thawed into. Considering dropping mines that can help me immediately to fit fuses that can me buff my gatling laser later is a genuinely interesting choice.

Speaking of settlements, they rock. slowly building a small shithole with a single workbench into a massive shithole with every type of workbench and way too many useless shops that you just sell bullets to and buy materials to make drugs out of you stupid greedy junkie. What was I talking about again, oh yeah base building. It's fun to see towns grow up and be filled with NPCs all doing their things.

Far harbor, very fun. Bethesda learned from the criticism of boring dialogue and meaningless choices and made this very plot heavy DLC. No spoilers but you can make bad guy choices and npcs react accordingly.

Guns are fun, yeah yeah I know ""fallout shouldn't be a shooter"" but eh, this is an fps let the guns be fun. Which they are, slowly building up a build and tinkering with your guns to make them well oiled machine. Damn I think gun tinkering is actually pretty fun too, I love it when games let you edit guns for more then just ""bigger mag"" ""more damage"". payday 2 has amazing weapon modding, deep mods really makes you feel like you made you own gun, and with the legendary effects too, you really can have a gun no one else gots.

1866,Is the Combat Rifle from Fallout 4 based on a real gun?,1599790057,"I'm gonna be a bit honest. This is going to be both a question and a hitpiece on the poor Combat Rifle. 

One of the major reasons I disliked 4 is the Combat Rifle. I really wonder if it's actually based on a real gun. It's basically the main go-to ballistic rifle in the game, in a series where gunplay is the bread and butter of the gameplay and universe, and I think it looks god-ugly. The way the top-back of it ends in some round part towards you in First Person, the pitiful sound it makes when it shoots. The weird generic look of it. The left-handed eject. It only looks marginally more like a real gun with the long barrel, but then it doesn't make sense for it to be automatic with a barrel that long. Using it just makes me want to use the Handmade Rifle instead, but I have to go all the way to Nuka World for it, and it has a level requirement for you to beat the Overboss to just get in. 

I'm pretty sure it's based on a real gun, but it feels like it's a toy-version of a real gun. At least, it looks especially so with a short barrel. The Handmade Rifle just looks so much better and like the assault rifle from all the previous games. The Combat Rifle is basically the only real possibly-auto rifle in the base game and it still looks like a gun someone designed, while looking at a real gun, and drawing a poor representation of it on a piece of paper. I have no idea why the Chinese Assault Rifle got cut and it's one of the biggest crimes I feel like Fallout 4 did.

 I'm not even going to fucking look at the base game Assault Rifle. 

I'm not particularly a gun-nut IRL but the fact 4 cut out two excellent real-world based assault rifle designs from Fallout 3 and a slew of excellent choices from New Vegas and gives you several abominations and maybe two actually good looking rifles, only relegated to being exclusively found in two separate DLC's was just stunningly disappointing and made me appreciate the guns in 3, NV, and even the Classic games more.",Fallout,dorito-pariah,False,/r/Fallout/comments/iqhlgn/is_the_combat_rifle_from_fallout_4_based_on_a/,1

I have really enjoyed organizing DND sessions before, but I never ran a continued campaign due to the work it requires. I either grew dissatisfied needing to railroad players into specific areas, or I lost motivation attempting to plan extreme amounts of content.

Then it hit me: what if I used an existing world? What if I set a DND campaign in the Mojave Wasteland of Fallout: New Vegas?

With hundreds of hours spent playing New Vegas, I am confident that the Mojave is a stellar setting for DND. If players want to know what’s south of Goodsprings, I know the answer is Primm. If I am making maps to play on, there is a pre-existing wealth of resources through the Fallout wiki. If players want a campaign where they can influence the world, the conflict for Hoover Dam affects every area. New Vegas seems to be the perfect setting!

Crazier things than this have happened in real life. But no, fucking children can not survive by themselves in a post apocalypse. Not only that, but they live right next to a fucking vault filled with super mutants. 

-The part in New Vegas where you talk to your brain. Fallout has a lot of wacky moments and even though this part was actually funny, it just felt too stupid even for New Vegas. 

-The boy stuck in the fridge in Fallout 4. That entire quest was just so mind blowingly stupid. Literal centuries have gone by, and NOBODY has found this kid? How has the kid not gone insane from staying in isolation that long? He should actually lose cognitive abilities. Also IIRC, his fucking parents were literal YARDS away from the goddamn fridge. There's just so much wrong with this quest and I'm sure everyone knows how fucking stupid it was.

-The fact that in the pre war resource wars, somehow the Middle East all unified to fight Europe?? I know Fallout is an alternate timeline, but the divergent from our timeline happened in the 1960s. Most of the Middle eastern conflicts today have roots from before the Fallout divergent in the 60s, meaning it's safe to assume that the Middle Eastern conflicts in our timeline are the same as the Fallout timeline.

If this is true, that means the Middle east in its current state today decided to unify to fight Europe in the Fallout universe.

I personally think they're the best faction to go with for your first playthrough of the game, like sure the Minutemen are good but they're not really connected to the Institute and they haven't really got anything to do with synths (two huge elements of the game), also there's like two members so they're not very interesting to me. 

Speaking of which, I think the Railroad have got some of the best characters in the game, I mean Deacon, Glory, Tinker Tom and Desdemona are all really charming to me, even if we didn't get to see a whole lot of some of them. Sidenote, I really wish we'd got to see more of Glory. It's surprising to me how much enjoyed her character based on how little I got to see of her. I really felt like I'd connected with the all the main characters there, especially Deacon. I mean, I think his backstory is really boring (oh wow, another dead spouse) but I'd like to believe that it was just another lie and his real backstory is a lot more interesting lol. He may not have that emotional depth of Nick Valentine or even Hancock, but I still love having him around. The shit he comes out with makes me laugh and characters with a sense of humour are always a win tbf. Honestly I feel like i'd have missed out on a lot if I'd chosen another faction on my first playthrough, the Brotherhood felt so cold and lifeless in comparison. That's just my opinion though.

People argue that all the Railroad does is help synths, that they don't benefit the Commonwealth in any other way and to that I say, that's the whole point... They exist to help the most oppressed group of people in the Commonwealth, the people most humans wouldn't give the time of day, and that's if they don't straight up kill them. Humanity is in a shitty situation sure, but most of them have eachother, and even the ghouls have eachother but the escapee synths have no chance of surviving without the Railroad. And why shouldn't SOMEONE try and help synths anyway? They're trying to escape slavery and persecution. It's not a waste of time because they're people too and deserve as much of a chance at life as anyone else. Also, it's not like Railroad are there to take over the Commonwealth with a synth army at their backs, they're there to help the synths that already exist, they don't want more to exist.

For my current playthough I decided to try out the Brotherhood of Steel for a bit, at least until I got to Blind Betrayal as I didn't bother with them at all in my first playthrough. (I'm going for the Minutemen ending where I leave all the factions alive.) And I've got to say, for me, the Brotherhood's only selling points were Danse and the Prydwen. In fact, I only joined them to see what Danse was like as a companion. But the rest of their story... felt cold. I mean I guess that's the point really but still. Danse and Haylen were the only characters I liked, and I use the term 'like' very loosely because if these people existed in real life I'd probably hate them. I mean they're working for a group of racist bigots lol. And don't even get me started on Maxon. Honestly if it didn't mean I'd lose Danse as a companion, I'd have shot him by now, he's such a miserable character. Again I'm sure that's the point, but damn the game REALLY wants you to feel bad about siding with the Brotherhood. Desdemona isn't the most interesting character in the world but you can tell she's got a good heart and she makes you feel like you're actually a part of something important. Maxon on the other hand treats you like shit. He's got a cool coat though. 

The Brotherhood are already pretty powerful so I didn't feel like I made much of a difference in joining them, aside from infiltratrating the Institute I guess. With the Railroad, entering the Institute felt a lot more important, because EVERYTHING about these guys is related to the Institute. The Brotherhood want to take the Institute down, yeah, but to me, it didn't feel as though they were taking as big of a risk in sending me there. The Institute could take down the Railroad so easily if they found them, and they show you how this is the case by taking you to the Switchboard. The Railroad are tiny, and they have to be secretive to survive and I just found that so much more engaging because you know that their entire existence hinges on your choices, it's not like that with any other faction. I suppose except for the Institute...but those guys are really powerful as well, so it doesn't really feel as rewarding when you're fighting for them. You're just beating up the little guy. I think that's a lot of what it boils down to for me, it felt a lot more rewarding to win as the smallest faction. Sneaking around the Prydwen and then blowing it up felt a lot more rewarding than just kicking down the Railroad's door with a small army decked out in suits of power armor. The Railroad stood no chance in that situation because of their size and lack of resources. I felt like a shitty person when I did it. I don't know why it hurt as much as it did to see all their names on that list, especially Deacon's. Idk why im so invested in them all aha. Usually when I side with the factions I see as 'evil' in videogames I don't come out feeling like a bad person irl but in this case I did, oops. By the way, I'm still doing the Minutemen ending where nobody is destroyed so I loaded an older save after I did it, I just wanted to see what would happen.

To be honest, I think I've spent too much time travelling with Nick Valentine and Deacon to really give an unbiased perspective on this whole thing, but I guess that wasn't really the point of this post anyway. I just really like the Railroad. Sure, maybe some of their methods are flawed but you can tell they're good people. To me, The Minutemen are alright, the Brotherhood of Steel are racist bigots and the Insitute are straight up supervillains. But it's all just my opinion ofc.

1972,Why it bothers me when people compare Legate Lanius to Colonel Autumn,1599665033,"So there's this video by Many A True Nerd called [Fallout 3 is Better Than You Think]( 1. Lanius doesn't appear before in the game;
2. Your character has no reason to personally dislike Lanius;
3. Lanius doesn't have a reason to back down.

I have seen both of this criticisms be echoed by people in the community too, so I think it's valid to respond to them. Criticism number 1 seems to be unaware of the deconstruction that happens with Lanius. He's hyped throughout the game as the ""Monster of the East"", a butcher in the battlefield. When you finally see him, he's inhumanly large (for FO standards). But when you talk to him, he's the most eloquent character in the entire game. This sort of deconstruction is something Obsidian likes to do, for more examples, see KotOR II.

Criticism number 2 is a fundamental misunderstanding of Lanius' purpose. It's funny how MATN brings up how Caesar's and Lucius' story of Lanius doesn't match and how Ulysses thinks it's not the same person under the mask, and he brings that up as a negative, when that's the point. When you face Lanius, you're not standing against an individual, you're stranding against an ideology. F:NV is entirely about ideologies, not a personal journey like I'd argue FO3 is. That's why your character have no reason to personally dislike Lanius. What he does have, is a reason to dislike what Lanius represents: the Legion, and their ideology.

Criticism number 3 especially bothers me because it's like people don't read the dialogue choices they're picking and it's about how pointing out that the Legion would be spreading itself too thin to hold Nevada as well as Arizona shouldn't be enough to convince Lanius. Except it's exactly what's happening with the NCR: they're trying to hold California as well as Nevada, and they're spread too thin. In fact, that's exactly what made it possible for the Legion to attack in the first place. It has already been established that Lanius is fanatical, but he isn't irrational, so showing him an example that's right in his face is perfectly reasonable to convince him. Caesar condemns the NCR for repeating the mistakes of pre-war American government, and yet here he is repeating the mistakes of the NCR, it's almost poetic. And continuing in this vain of poetry and repeating the mistakes of the government you're imitating, I always assumed the Legion spreading itself too thin was a nod to Ancient Rome itself. You could cite a thousand reasons that contributed in one way or another to the fall of the Western Roman Empire, and one of them would be how the gigantic size of Empire became a problem to govern efficiently. Anyway, I'm staying too far from the discussion.

This all of text isn't to criticize or attack FO3 or the people who enjoy it, nor do that to MATN. He's a passionate guy about a franchise he loves and that's great. I just wanted to do my best to respond to some criticisms of Lanius I perceive as incorrect.

1974,Randall Clark's Story Broke Me,1599664300,"Ever since I started playing New Vegas, one of the DLC's really stood out to me from all the rest. That being Honest Hearts. Why? At the time, I couldn't really tell you. 

The way Zion valley is and the tribes. A random job you decide to take after listening to the radio broadcast, met with the familiar and lovable voice acting of Dave Finnoy (Other wise known as Lee from the walking dead). And lets not forget that opening. Holy shit, when the white legs attacked and all of our caravan hands died off one by one, you felt lost, in unknown territory and our only option is to push onward and hope we can find a way  back. Considering it was probably the first DLC I ever played, maybe that's why it stuck with me so much

Not to mention the fact that the DLC even ties back to the main story with Joshua Graham and that deep sexy voice of his and how interesting of a character he is. At the time I didn't really know much about what was going on, but I did find myself enthralled by the entire DLC, and kept my attention the entire way through. While being on the shorter side of the DLC's I still thought it was really good. I think I went with Daniel's ending when I had first played the DLC, and found out something quite interesting.

The Courier doesn't believe in God. Whether or not you the player does. Which is fascinating.

But that's not why I'm writing this.

What made this DLC go from ""Pretty cool, and interesting"" to phenomenal was the story of Randall Clark.

*Who's Randall Clark?* 

For those who either never bothered or never knew him or his story. A long story short is Randall Clark is known as the survivalist or better known to the Sorrows as ""The Father in the Caves."" He then spent approximately 47 YEARS surviving Zion valley after the bombs fell in 2077.

Like a lot of people, I overlooked the story, and missed a lot of context, nuance, and impact the story had.

But after a while and finally coming back to New Vegas, and going through Zion Valley again, this time, I went through the process of finding each and every one of the terminals and reading them. I'm much older, and much wiser then I was a few years ago.

As I read each terminal entry aloud, to myself. The entire time, I felt a tightness in my chest, especially in the later terminal entries. Each one was harder and harder to read through not because it was bad, but because I knew where he ended up and I found myself struggling to keep it together.

Then came the final note. 

I got to the third paragraph before the tears started streaming down my cheeks, but I kept reading. And even now, looking at the transcript in my tabs, I still feel the tightness in my chest, and that line ""I tell them that I'm giving them Zion as a gift to make up for all the sorrows of their lives so far and all the sorrows man has visited on man."" never fails to bring a tear to my eye.

Whatever your thoughts were on the DLC, the best thing about this DLC was that story. I'm a tough nut to crack, but even I know and will admit, I cried during this story because of how well it's written. To this day, it has been an inspiration in a lot of my writing. The only time I ever cried that hard was playing FFXV.

1997,I didn't like Fallout 2 because of its' humor,1599632485,"Let me make it clear that I love Fallout 2's main story, the enclave are one of my favorite factions in the FO universe and most of the side places and missions that you can go on are cool as well. But what makes me dislike the game is its' humor. FO 1 had dark humor in it and it worked extremely well especially with the setting. FO 2 on the other hand completely messed up the game by cramming it full of jokes and references of the late 90s, using meta jokes in reference to the first game, the possible 3rd game and the current game. Maybe I just had a few bad play throughs but boy did I come across so many jokes and reenactments of Monty Python skits that it made me unimmersed from the game. If I got curious about a mysterious stranger guarding a bridge oh wait it's another skit reenactment. Oh wait there's a talking mole rat, okay he's talking about Cheesy poofs. Oh wait what does this npc have to say? Oh right they're making a meta reference to Fallout 1 and how they might appear in the next game. Making pop culture jokes in any game does not make a game any better.

The same thing happened with the Far Cry series. Far Cry 3 was the jump start to what the series is today and is nothing like the first two original games making it a far cry from the originals. See what I did there? I went out of my way to make a stupid joke distracting you from the main point and that is exactly what games like FO2 does. They go out the way to make some joke they deem hilarious that at the end it leaves the player or viewer disoriented and they have to refocus at the task at hand.  Now going back to the Far Cry series, FC3 made the series what is today however, FC4 derailed quite a bit. In the previous game when driving there may have been some music to listen to on the radio, but usually it matched a lot with the action and suspension when fleeing from enemies. FC4 changed all of that and instead added a DJ. Now I don't remember much of the music that was on the radio, but I sure do remember the DJ and he was no 3 Dog. Not to trigger anyone reading this, but imagine a beta virgin looser having his own radio show in a bunker that he is too afraid to come out of especially at the end of the game. This guy was not only cringe, but he constantly pop culture references, he even called the main antagonist the Joker because of the way that he dressed. Even the main antagonist calls you up from time to time name dropping celebrities that he wishes to see or to kill. It was completely over the top to the point where the wasn't as fun as it should of been.

Both FO2 and FC4 have an interesting main story, but both suffer from the fait of having jokes for the lols and not grounded in the lore or environment that they are set in.",Fallout,The_Mad_Poptart,False,/r/Fallout/comments/ipaqg0/i_didnt_like_fallout_2_because_of_its_humor/,1
1999,FO4 Story is better than you thought (Major Spoiler for anyone who hasn't played the game),1599630062,"Alright so I'm on my 8th play through of the game and I got to the aforementioned Kellogg memory sequence (which I usually  don't skip simply for immersion) and I was going through the scene of where Kellogg had Shaun in his Diamond City apartment. It is at this point that Kellogg dialogue changes when you access each individual aspect (like when go up to Shaun or Kellogg and hit access memory) he starts talking in the past meta tense. What I mean by this is that he makes a point of how he should of killed the sole survivor and it was one of his many mistakes, but that didn't matter because the institute is going to get what's coming to them. He is already talking from beyond the grave. 

So back to the scene with young Shaun. Kellogg thought in that moment that maybe the old was out smarting him in some way since babysitting Shaun wasn't the ideal job for Kellogg. Now when he mentions the old man, I think this threw off the community in a lot of ways cause one maybe they thought he was referring to old man Stockton, or two that there was another old man who was the leader of the institute. For years I've seen a lot of Youtubers try to debunk this theory of who was in charge before Shaun, but what I told you the old man that Kellogg is referring to is the real Shaun.

Now follow me here, they got Shaun from vault 111 because his dna is untouched by the harsh wasteland environment. They needed his dna to make the synths, so therefore wouldn't the institute make sure that Shaun is in a safe and secure environment. Diamond City is no safe haven, so Shaun would have no business even going there if it meant that the institute's future was on the line. Furthermore why would he be in the hands off a cold blooded gun for hire, than be in the safety of scientists and doctors? Father (the real Shaun) has admitted to the sole survivor in a future quest that he was the one that released them and that he wanted to see how far they would get. So with that Father set Kellogg up, he had him babysit the younger synth version of himself for months on end thus creating a false memory for the sole survivor to pick up and give them hope that their kid is okay but a little bit older than usual. 

The question that could completely blow that last paragraph out of the water is if Kellogg was already part of the institute when he captured Shaun, wouldn't he know that Father is setting him up since he knew what Shaun looked like growing up?

Yes that is an interesting point that Kellogg could and maybe would see this coming from a mile away, but remember that he has all of those robotic replacements? He most likely gotten them from the institute as a form of payment, so maybe Tinker Tom was right in the sense that there tiny robots planted in the food and that they spy on you. But either way this was Kellogg's second chance at being a father, something that a guy like him didn't deserve but secretly wanted. 

At the end of the scene Shaun gets taken by the courser and Kellogg is given orders to track Virgil down. But Kellogg was never meant to kill Virgil in fact the only reason why it was brought up is so that the sole survivor could see it. Not to mention that it didn't take Kellogg 50 years to get where he is at Fort Hagen. Which is yet another bread crumb left by Father because he knows about his fait with cancer he knows that if anyone determined enough to be the leader of the institute, it would be his parent. 

These details as a whole were at least in my opinion poorly presented to the player. It's very easy to overlook these details especially on the first play through but to completely mess up a cue that even the Fallout YouTube community overlooked is pretty terrible. Despite that the details are pretty neat nonetheless.   

Now I totally agree with the fanbase in how Bethesda completely fumbled at the opportunity to have the player kill Father and rescue the synth child and then not knowing that the kid is a synth unless you went with a different ending entirely. With that part added it would of the story a little bit better.

TL;DR Father (aka real Shaun) out smarted us and had planned everything from the start to even go as far as to plant a fake memory in Kellogg's brain to give the sole survivor the delusion that Shaun was younger and giving the sole survivor hope and a trail to find him (Father) in the institute so that they could take his place.",Fallout,The_Mad_Poptart,False,/r/Fallout/comments/ipa9fk/fo4_story_is_better_than_you_thought_major/,1

2018,A piece of OUR action! A missed opportunity I would have loved to see explored.,1601647120,"If you've never seen the episode, I'm going to be talking about details from it below, proceed at your own risk...

&amp;#x200B;

A Piece of the Action is one of my more favorite TOS episodes.  It's funny and just all in all a well paced and done episode.  It's where I learned to play Fizzbin and that we saw that Kirk makes a lousy taxi driver. 😂 

But as you probably remember, after Kirk negotiates with all the mob bosses to get a percentage of the 'action' for the Federation (which Spock asks how he will explain that 😂), the beam back to the Enterprise and McCoy thinks he left his communicator down in Bela Oxmyx's office.  Kirk and Spock are both concerned because the Iotians are intelligent and copy everything they can and if they take apart the communicator, they will find out what the  transtator, a component in the communicator, does and that it's the basis for every important piece of equipment the Federation has.  And of course when McCoy really starts worrying that it's really that bad, that's when Kirk says, "" Well, in a few years, the Iotians may demand a piece of OUR action!""

I would have loved to see an episode, maybe in TNG, that would have had the Iotians showing up again, this time more on the same level as the Federation and wanting to 'renegotiate' the deal that was struck by Kirk and the Enterprise.

2019,"People like DS9 the best, can you help me understand why?",1601645565,"I haven't seen DS9 before, and I am trying to watch it but I just... can't like it. I'm at season 3 episode 2. It's not that I don't like war-focused fiction or dislike more violent shows. To the contrary, in fact. It's just... I have some serious complaints at core elements. I want to know why people think the show is good as I often hear it's the best and I just can't understand why now that I've seen it.

I know the show is mostly about the Dominion War form what I've heard, the problem with that is the Dominion is... Just incredibly stupid to me. It's built up to be this big bad empire, but no one even knows if its leaders exist. They just operate as if they do because the Jem'Hadar do exist. Which would be fine, if the Jem'Hadar were not the single most plot-stupid foes in fiction (as far as I've encountered.).

The Jem'Hadar are shown in their first appearance to have personal cloaking devices, but they board the Defiant while visible. They have guns which are very effective, but almost always use them as clubs, even running to melee from save positions near cover to hit their foes instead of just shooting them (just have the bad guys miss, directors. You can have the heroes survive because the bad-guys miss. It's possible to do this!). They are shown to have borg-style forcefield penetration on their soldiers, if they can do that at that scale and their weapons can just voop right through Galaxy Class starship shields like the shield was off, why do they even board a ship to begin with? Why did they suicide ram that forgetably named galaxy class ship when their weapons could obviously do just as much damage with like, 2-3 more disruptor shots? Who is their tactical advisors? That one general from the recent Star Wars films who ordered his ship destroy the base on the planet instead of the ships they were evacuating too?

Politically, the Dominion is unforgivably stupid. If they owned the space on the other side of the wormhole, they should have made contact and told people they know could not possibly know of their existence ""this is our space, keep out or die."" Instead it acts... not at all. Just being some boogyman that people cowtoe to and their own citizens are not even sure if the Dominion's leaders even exist. How can you be that hands off yet everyone knows your Death Troopers and does anything they say. It. Makes. No. Sense. The Dominion, in any real world, would be thought of like the Yakuza or the Mafia. They do not act like a government yet they are said to be one. Makes. No. Sense.

Then of course, there's the non-dominon stuff. For starters, my god so many child actors... Why? Second, why should any of us care who becomes the next Kai? We learn nothing about the Bajoran's religion even though its' so important to them they have a major sect of their religion willing to go full Al Qaeda and blow up a school for daring to teach basic science facts instead of their dogmatic religion that's not even true because the entities in that wormhole had NO IDEA the Bajorans even existed before Cisco derped into their wormhole which was somehow never found in spire of being like 2 hours distant from a planet which was once the center of a trade empire. YEAH, RIGHT, MHM. That's possible.

So yeah, we're either watching religious extremists using terrorism to enforce their religion we know nothing about other than its gods do not exist (which is dumb in Star Trek because many religions gods DO exist!), or the Cardassians being pissy they let Bajor go, or diffrent terrorists waging a farmor's war over stupid, stupid, stupid reasons for a post-scarsity society like the Federation (Go anywhere else in the infinite expanse of space, you MORONS!), or the single least believable space empire in fiction and I'm including the Independence Day Aliens, the Signs aliens, and the Psychlos in the list of dumbest space empires.

Seriously, what am I missing here? Why is this show good? Because it's Trek but darker and the 90s were drowning in pointless dark because it was in fashion? Is that why?

\-It's basically the Kirk and Spock and show, they go on every mission and have the most lines/screen time.

\-Uhura, Sulu and Scotty are really underutilized. I guess I'm used to 90s trek where there are episodes that would focus on specific crew members. I'd like to get to know them better.

\-McCoy is a badass. Khan had his hand wrapped around his throat, along with a knife and the doctor stays cool the entire time. He doesn't flinch or call for security. He just says ""*Well, either choke me or cut my throat! Make up your mind!""*

\-If a specialist is needed for an away mission, it's usually a woman and she will join the episode's villain or be a damsel in distress. She won't actually help with the mission at all. 

\-Women in general, have nothing to do on that ship. I understand it was made in the 60s, but it seems they mostly act as secretaries, nurses and captain's assistant (which Kirk always takes umbrage with)

\-I'm surprised how many near-omnipotent beings the ship encounters

\-Also struck by how many times Will Shatner is shirtless or has his shirt ripped.

\-I liked how they reused footage from the Cage, to tie in those events to the main story.

2056,We need to talk about the Ocampa.,1601604241,"So the Ocompa, one of Voyager's more interesting creations. What I want to mention though, is how ludicrously powerful they are! 

Firstly, can we just assume the one birth thing was implanted by the Caretaker(s) to ensure their population didn't explode, and that with him/them gone they'll have something more along the lines of a  potential birth every year or two.

 Great. Now, our only really good point of reference is Kes, so lets go through what she's done. Well, when trying to warm tea, she boiled Tuvok's blood, she fried an entire storage bay worth of plants, she warped reality around her involuntarily, and sent Voyages 10 warp 9.5.7 years through space in seconds, without any significant trouble. So, this sounds strong.

Now before we unpack the kinds of things they can do with that, lets go over their weaknesses. Their about as frail as humans, weak by galactic standards, but no real trouble since melee combat isn't that common. Low population/procreation, even with our previous assumption, their isn't going to be a lot of Ocampa, and their numbers won't recuperate at any significant speed, and of course, their life span is, laughably short.

So how do we deal with these weaknesses. The physical limitations aren't going to be a significant problem, nor are they easy to fix. As to the life span, since age is the degradation of genetic code, it could be ""cured"", but I can't think of any trek technology that has been shown to be able to do so, but Kes could seemingly manipulate, quarks, or something smaller, maybe? With training, they might be able to ""de-age"" one another, and with that, our birth rate problem is solved.

So, lets go to weapons of war. Well, assuming the technology of an alpha quadrant power, they could have cloaked ships, traveling at high warp so small, and maneuverable that most things simply can't hit them, an they could dedicate resources normal used for weapons to thrust/steering, since the pilot could through ships around like toys (just through one into a planet). So the big ships everyone loves are out, what about small ones? Surely those could shoot down one of these runabouts of death? Only if they drop out of cloak, which they won't have to, because the Ocampa inside is a weapon. Ok, so no known, or theoretically ship could beat these in combat.

So what about terrestrial combat? Their physically weak, and you could use cloaked landing vessels to move your troops in right? Wrong! In any traditional battle field theirs nothing stopping one Ocompa from, say setting the cloths of everyone within a hundred feet or so one fire. Flame retardant fabric I hear you say. Great, now your boiling their blood instead, and throwing them, their battlements, vehicles, and artillery around like toys.

So bombardment then? Well they could just catch the bombs. But you could cloak them, I suppose. So rapid bombing runs could work, but with their telekinesis cleaning up debris, and erecting new structures will take significantly less time. Plus, you'll be shooting blind since spying will be basically impossible, and surveillance platforms would need to be cloaked/hidden, which means their ability to gather intelligence will be limited, and it'll be hard to install them without being spotted since they will have numerous ships, that could be anywhere.

So. Let's say, through a long, bloody war, you get them all but beat, they have only their capital, your entire fleet is surrounding them, aaaaaaannnnnnndddddd they just changed history so whatever tricks you pulled to win, they now know about weeks in advance.

2060,Why you love/hate Lower Decks?,1601594095,"Hailing Trekkies. I recently got into watching Lower Decks, and searching about the series I have seen a lot of controversy about the series. Lots of love and appreciation but also lots of criticism and ""i had a serious face the whole show"" opinions about it.

So I wanna hear from you guys if you like it or not and the reasons.

I will leave my opinion: I'm on the lover side. First and foremost I consider myself an star trek *afficionado.* I haven't watched Picard or DS9, and I have only partially watched the first seasons of TOS, TNG, Voyager, Enterprise and Discovery. The movies is a similar story: my first ever encounter with ST was when I was a kid while I watched Nemesis on the cinema. then I have only watched the Kelvin Timeline movies, generations and The Motion Picture. But besides that I know my stuff.

And that is what I think is the first thing you need to watch Lower Decks. The show is full of references to the knowers of the lore. Every single detail is made carefully, and the more you know about the ST universe, the better, because a part of the series is the references. It's like being in a party with all sorts of people, and you tell a mix of general jokes alongside inside jokes that only you and your mates can get. You can watch LD with people slightly interested on it, but you will get the most if you know things from the star trek universe. One example is on 1x09 with all the lens glares making a nod on the JJ Abrahams Films.

That gets me into the second thing needed to enjoy LD (and in my opinion the most important): being able to make fun of the ST universe. First I need to make a confession: first and foremost I'm a Stargate fan. and stargate has the best example I can think of of taking a breath and laughing of ourselves: the 100th and 200th episode. I'm not going to spoil it, but the TL;DR of both episodes is that a TV station is going to make a series *reeeeaaaly* similar of what is happening on the Stargate Program, and the military decides that they should influence the production of the series so in case there is an info leak, they can use the series as scapegoat. Both episodes are a carnival of making fun of the tropes not only from the series, but from the Sci-Fi genre and even the world of TV producers.

2085,It occurs to me that the Galaxy class starships have a horrible record in Starfleet service!,1601574159,"In re-reading one of my favorite Star Trek novels, *The Buried Age* by Christopher L. Bennett, I reached a part in the story when Data (then a Lieutenant in the story as it is set in the ""Lost Era"" between TOS and TNG) begins performing long term performance simulations of the unbuilt Galaxy class Explorers. 

What he finds is nothing short of astonishing!  According to Data's conclusions, every Galaxy class starship should only have an operational lifespan of between 1.6 and 11.4 years after commissioning before catastrophic failure sets in.  Spoiler: &gt;!This causes Data to suspect that his neural net may have been tampered with and results in the plot being moved forward!&lt;

As I think about it, though, I believe this analysis to be factually correct!  Most (if not all) of the Galaxy class ships seen on screen meet rather spectacular ends within a few years of being commissioned.  The USS Yamato was destroyed in 2365 from the infection of a computer virus, less than 5 years after she was launched.  USS Odyssey was destroyed by the Jem Hadar in 2370 and the USS Enterprise-D was destroyed in 2371 in the movie *Star Trek: Generations* giving life spans of approximately 10 and 11 years respectively.

In contrast, many Federation starships and starship classes have much better lifespans in Starfleet service.  The original Constitution class Enterprise (NCC-1701) was in service for approximately forty years (2245-2285) before being scuttled in orbit around the newly formed Genesis Planet.  Per Memory Alpha: ""Being forty years old at the time of its destruction, the Enterprise had surpassed its designer's original projected eighteen-year endurance by twenty-two years, when the ship was launched back in 2245.""

In fact, many starships of the Oberth, Miranda and Excelsior classes are seen to still be in service well into the later part of the 24th century.  Examples include the USS Tsiolkovsky, USS Lantree and the USS Hood.  It's safe to assume that these ships withstood the test of time much better than their Galaxy class bretheren.",startrek,airmaildolphin,False,/r/startrek/comments/j3ddt6/it_occurs_to_me_that_the_galaxy_class_starships/,0

2093,Predicciones de Star Trek: Discovery Temporada 3 [Español Latinoamerica],1601564360,"Saludos a todos, hoy quería iniciar el hilo previo al comienzo de la 3th. temporada de Star Trek: Discovery, el cual gracias a una filtración en el doblaje latino por parte del Twittero conocido como u/RemerasRojas reveló un fragmento del tráiler en español latino donde ampliaba algo más de la sinopsis oficial de la temporada, como sabemos, en el tráiler oficial de CBS All-Access junto a los paneles de la #StarTrekDayAtHome, publicados en el canal de Youtube de dicha cadena, así como los traílers de la temporada revelaban un hecho cataclísmico que será el eje central del viaje del USS Discovery al siglo 32, donde se da a entender que llegaban alrededor del año 3188 casi más de unos 900 años apróximadamente, y el cual se daba a entender que la Federación sufría de un especie de colapso, mientras la tripulación junto con la nave del USS Discovery se estrellaba en un mundo desolado, por otra parte se mencionaba que la Federación o al menos como ente político de los cuadrantes alfa y beta se había fragmentado, con esto se complementaba con la mencionada filtración (Enlace aquí [ &amp;#x200B;

Por otro lado, debido a este incipiente fragmento de teaser he llegado a postular la siguiente teoría de lo que ocurrió en este siglo XXXII:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Si recoramos que en la serie TNG (Tne Next Generation) hay un episodio relacionado al uso abusivo de la tecnología Warp en la que el uso constante en una región específica luego de mucho tiempo de ser utlizada una región autorizada por la Federación como corredor de naves la tecnología Warp estaba provocando crear el desgarre del subespacio, quizás tomando la idea de este episodio acerca de la creación de estas fracturas del subespacio, sea responsables de las consecuenciasdel mismo, que, para el siglo XXXII sea resultado de dichas consecuencias, la separación o destrucción de varios mundos de la Federación, y como se ve en la Bandera, solo quedaron como miembros los 4 fundadores;

&amp;#x200B;

2. Otra teoría que podría ser es, que esté vinculado al uso ilegal de la Partícula omega con fines cientificos, y algún grupo de científicos renegados de la Federación ocasionó el uso ilegal de dicha partícula ocasionando en alguna región del espacio federal o fronterizo una explosión de enormes proporciones que haya destruido el subespacio o el mismo cuadrante Alpha como para separar o destruir civilizaciones que llevaron a cabo la separación o destrucción de varios mundos de la Federación, y como se ve en la Bandera, solo quedaron como miembros los 4 fundadores;

&amp;#x200B;

2094,Star Trek: Discovery Season 3 predictions,1601564166,"Greetings everyone, today I wanted to start the thread prior to the beginning of the 3th. season of Star Trek: Discovery, which thanks to a leak in the Latin dubbing by the Twitter user known as u/RemerasRojas revealed a fragment of the trailer in Latin Spanish where he expanded something more than the official synopsis of the season, as we know, in the CBS All-Access official trailer along with the #StarTrekDayAtHome panels, published on the channel's YouTube channel, as well as the season's trailers revealed a cataclysmic event that will be the central axis of the USS Discovery's journey to the 32nd century , where it is implied that they arrived around the year 3188 almost more than approximately 900 years, and which was implied that the Federation suffered from a kind of collapse, while the crew together with the USS Discovery ship crashed in a desolate world, on the other hand it was mentioned that the Federation or at least as a political entity of the alpha and beta quadrants had been fragmented, with this it was complemented by the aforementioned leak n (Link here [ &amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, due to this incipient teaser fragment I have come to postulate the following theory of what happened in this XXXII century:

&amp;#x200B;

1. If we recall that in the TNG (Tne Next Generation) series there is an episode related to the abusive use of Warp technology in which the constant use in a specific region after a long time of using a region authorized by the Federation as a broker Warp technology was causing the creation of the subspace tear, perhaps taking the idea of ​​this episode about the creation of these subspace fractures, is responsible for the consequences of the same, that, by the XXXII century is the result of said consequences, the separation or destruction of various worlds of the Federation, and as seen in the Flag, only the 4 founders remained as members;

&amp;#x200B;

2. Another theory that could be is that it is linked to the illegal use of the omega particle for scientific purposes, and some group of renegade scientists from the Federation caused the illegal use of said particle causing an explosion in some region of federal or border space. of enormous proportions that it has destroyed the subspace or the same Alpha quadrant as to separate or destroy civilizations that carried out the separation or destruction of several worlds of the Federation, and as seen in the Flag, only the 4 founders remained as members;

&amp;#x200B;

3. Another possibility is that a war worse than that carried out against the domain against an external agent (Invasion against some other people from another galaxy of the Local Group) led centuries of post-war mistrust against the Federation than the separation or destruction of several worlds of the Federation, and as seen in the Flag, only the 4 founders remained as members;

&amp;#x200B;

4. My last theory is, related to a type of galactic weapon that provoked such terrible consequences as to constrain the aforementioned.

**Episode 9 - ""Crisis Point""**

* The ""rats"" Mariner helped overthrow are Anticans, one of the two warring factions brought aboard the *Enterprise* in ""Lonely Among Us."" The other species in that episode, the Selay, were reptilian but don't appear to resemble the people here.
* When condemned to therapy, Mariner exclaims ""this is the 80s, we don't have psychiatric problems!"" In addition to canonically establishing the series' timeframe as sometime between 2380 and 2387 (the stardate and promotional material narrow it down to 2380), this dialogue references the feel-good Yuppie era of the 1980s that prompted Gene Roddenberry to include a counselor aboard his new starship in TNG.
* The Deckers are skeet shooting with a hologram of Leonardo da Vinci, who was a recurring holo-mentor of Captain Janeway's during the middle years of VOY.
* Boimler has uploaded seven years' of crew logs into his simulation, suggesting the *Cerritos'* bridge crew has been adventuring for that amount of time. TNG, DS9 and VOY each lasted seven seasons, and the latter two would have been occurring during the Cerritos' seven-year mission.
* As Mariner reprograms the simulation, a script flashes by on the screen. The dialogue it contains is taken from the LD episode ""Crisis Point.""
* I believe this is the first time we see the TNG font ""in canon.""
* The opening credits of Mariner's movie echo several of the first eight films (back in *my* day, films began with several minutes of opening credits...it was *awful*). The overture begins with the same fanfare as *Wrath of Khan* but then transitions into the LD theme (which I supposes canonizes that theme).
* Mariner calls Boimler a ""Xon."" During the 1970s pre-production began on a TOS reboot called ""Star Trek Phase II,"" and after Leonard Nimoy declined to appear his character was replaced by Xon, a Vulcan struggling to understand humanity. The character was fleshed out and cast, but the series was cancelled and recycled into *The Motion Picture* in which Spock returned. (if by chance you didn't know this, this is not one of my sarcastic half-truths)
* The ""hydroscoot"" has never appeared in the franchise...perhaps a reference to *Nemesis* introducing an entirely new ground vehicle for absolutely no reason.
* Freeman holds the Academy hydroscoot speed record; her bragging about some random Academy accomplishment officially makes her a Star Trek captain.
* The *Cerritos* has ""just gone through some upgrades.* Both the TOS and TNG *Enterprises* appeared visually different when making their cinematic debuts; the 1701-D got a few more bridge stations in *Generations* and the OG ship was completely refit in *The Motion Picture*.
* The crew does an emotional flyby of the *Cerritos* in a parody of the *Enterprise* introduction sequence that took up half of *The Motion Picture.* Similar flybys also occurred in *Wrath of Khan* and *Star Trek 2009.*
* The sequence also introduces a heavy light-blur and lens-flare effect which lasts much of the rest of the episode. Overuse of lens flares was a much-maligned trait of JJ Abrams when he directed ""The Visitor.""
* The *Cerritos* also gets a special movie warp effect, although the crackling lightning more resembles *Back to the Future* or *Highlander* and not any particular Trek film.
* Mariner's character Vindicta, ""vengeance personified,"" shares the revenge trait common among film villains such as Khan, Nero, and Khan.
* Winger plays Shempo instead of Boimler. Another actor being hastily employed to fulfill the remaining obligations of a deceased or departed actor is called a ""fake Shemp"" after the death of Shemp Howard while filming his final Three Stooges pictures.
* Mariner quotes from *The Tempest,* a play by ""William Shakespeare"" performed by Data in ""Emergence."" The line ""our revels now are ended"" was also quoted by Shakespeare-lover General Chang in *The Undiscovered Country.*
* Shaxs attempts to send the intruders to hell to meet the Pah-wraiths. These were the ""evil"" version of the Bajoran Prophets who attempted to seize control of the wormhole or the planet or the universe or whatever during DS9.
* Vindicta's Borg head creates a shield that deflects phaser fire. The Borg's main combat advantage is their ability to ""adapt"" to phasers after a short time.
* Tendi objects to the stereotype that Orions are pirates. Orions *are* pirates (at least until five years ago) and they ran a feared crime syndicate during the DS9 era.
* From u/pfc9769: Rutherford's technobabble includes ""indacontrols,"" ""sativents"" and ""rudimentary plasma filter,"" referencing the three primary variants of cannabis. Again, this was noticed by u/pfc9769. Like right away.
* The *Cerritos* is knocked out of orbit and its drive section is destroyed, echoing *Generations.* The saucer section lands on the planet in a somewhat less cozy manner than in the above film. *Generations* is one of three films in which the *Enterprise* is completely destroyed, and the ship crashes on a planet in every Kelvin film, including at an awkward angle in *Beyond.*
* Rutherford chirps that ""you can do all sorts of beaming stuff in a movie!"" The Kelvin films established long-range beaming, beaming while falling, beaming while riding a motorcycle, beaming while playing Beastie Boys, beaming while...
* Mariner calls for an emergency transport for Freeman. Data did the same thing for Picard in *Nemesis.*
* Fighting on a ""rickety metal catwalk"" occurred in *Insurrection,* *Nemesis,* *Star Trek 2009,* and maybe some others, I dunno.
* Toby the Targ is an unseen children's character mentioned in ""Tsunkatse.""
* The program comes to a conclusion. ""Holodeck malfunction"" episodes are one of the most common plot devices in...wait. Wait. This was a holodeck episode where the holodeck worked perfectly? Fuckin' 2020, man.
* Noticed by u/LesterBePiercin in previous episodes: the bartenders in the crew lounge wear the same outfits as the non-Guinan staff in Ten Forward during TNG.
* Vindicta reappears in a torpedo casket sunglasses case, as Spock did in *The Search for Spock.*

Enterprise to me only works as a name if it's supposed to be it's own separate show where all this past stuff doesn't exist. Where the fact that the ship is called Enterprise makes it special, as this is first time we are seeing it.

Star Trek: Enterprise, when looking at it amongst other titles just feels bland. Enterprise on it's own may be a minimalistic title for space adventurers, but Star Trek: Enterprise just feels like it's on that awkward ground of being too much and and yet not enough. 

Looking at ""Enterprise""? Oh well the title is referring to the ship on this show about humans exploring the unknown, not to mention the opening credits how shown the relevance of it's name when it comes to human exploration. Looking ""Star Trek: Enterprise""? Oh, well, it's Star Trek but..... the Enterprise version? Wait wasn't the original and next generation on an Enterprise? Wait it's a prequel? Why not call it ""Star Trek: The First Generation or some shit like that? Why is the name of the ship now relevant?""

It just feels like a lazy name unless it's under the context that it was just called Enterprise. I know this a minor thing to talk about, but IDK I just don't like the name Star Trek: Enterprise unless it about a show where the ship is somehow even more important than usual.

2114,"StarTrek - Into Darkness , a new theory.",1601524234,"
Firstly , I have seen a lot of negative reviews of this movie, I don't get why . And I have to admit I have never really been all that into the original series. I was more of a next generation kinda guy. But anyone who has watched any StarTrek movie or show knows about the originals. Having said that, I will admit most of what I do know about the originals is from the movies they put out, including Generations( the movie as well as guest appearances on the show).

So all of this is going to be from the perspective of it simply being a stand alone movie( mainly connected to the reboot, obviously)

Anyway , I remember thinking that when I watched that movie it was really good.

But the theory is that the Enterprise is a body, a living thing, and each of the main cast represents a different aspect of a personality of the being that is the Enterprise.

The theory is as follows, Spock, is the intellectual part ( the mind, logic), Scotty is the conscience ( guilt, right and wrong, morality), Kirk is the Heart ( the core, the spirit ),McCoy is the gut reaction ( instinct , emotion ) , now I had difficulty finding appropriate attributes to assign Chekhov and Uhura, so I guess they could be youth  ( hope, optimism) and communication ( empathy , sympathy , patience) . Still kind of working on the last two. But bear with me.

So all of what follows would adhere to this interpretation.

Now It would be very easy to say that things began to go wrong with Khan, but that's not exactly true. It began with McCoy leaving the ship. With Kirk choosing to ignore him. And if you notice things began to go right with his return. More specifically with Kirk apologizing and asking him to return. 

What got me thinking this is actually a wonderful scene in this movie, it's the one with Kirk and Spock speaking to Khan, and even notice the way it's shot. ( I highly recommend anyone reading this to go back and watch that scene) . But more importantly, Scotty.

Now Khan , in this interpretation, is simply all Heart and Mind , now that sounds like a good thing, but this isn't so, he doesn't have a conscience, yes we understand his motivation, but put simply he is Spock and Kirk combined with none of the attributes that the others have to offer. And his actions reflect that. ( Like I said it was Khan that helped lead me to this theory, and he is a wonderful villain in my opinion, both versions) .

And yes, again, I have seen the reviews, I understand that it cannot be helped to compare these new versions to the originals, I get that. 

Now the antithesis of Enterprise would be the other Ship, the USS Vengeance, and notice that with the help of Scotty , it starts to fall apart ( so to speak ). But even more importantly, it's most effective with Khan in control, even more so than with it's original Captain , and this is reflected in it's overall design. 
It's not an exploratory vessel, and wouldn't you know it, Khan has no such need for such a vessel, in effect has no use for the other attributes or main cast. 

Now this is kind of slapped together, I haven't seen the movie in a long time. I haven't even thought of the movie until about half an hour ago or the theory I came up with for that matter. But anyway , that's the theory.

I'll add a short spoiler free description of each episode and why I think it makes for a good Halloween episode. 

**The Next Generation:**

1x25 Conspiracy: Picard receives a warning from a colleague about a potential conspiracy within Starfleet. Upon investigating the crew notices that something strange is going on. Very atmospheric episode that reminds me of the movie They Live. Probably has the goriest scene in all of Star Trek. 

2x16 Q Who: Q claims that mankind is not ready for the dangers that lurk in the unexplored space and sends the crew far away where they meet a new foe. Some of you might be surprised by this entry but the build up, the suspense and eerie atmosphere are really well done. Mild recommendation for episode 1x26 because it sets up this episode. 

4x05 Remember Me: Crewmembers on the Enterprise start disappearing but no one seems to notice with the exception of Dr Crusher. Classic Twilight Zone-esque set up. 

4x17 Night Terrors: The Enterprise is trapped in an unknown part of space where they find a federation ship with most of the crew dead. Soon the crew of the enterprise starts to be affected by whatever killed the crew of the federation ship. They start to act different and hallucinate. My personal favorite scary episode that I highly recommend.

4x18 Identity Crisis: Something urges a former away team that La Forge was a part of to a planet they investigated years prior. Their new investigation finds that they weren't alone on the planet. Very intriguing set up and has some chilling scenes! 

6x05 Schisms: Some crew members suffer from exhaustion and suddenly reacting oddly to various objects that seem to trigger post traumatic responses. Meanwhile a mysterious subspace pocket appears on the enterprise. Also one of my favorite episodes that has a great build up. 

6x21 Frame of Mind: Riker loses his mind when he keeps switching between being on the Enterprise and in an alien hospital. He starts to question what's real and what's fake. Classic horror set up about what happens when our reality might be a delusion. 

7x06 Phantasms: Data developed a dream program but suddenly he starts having bizarre nightmares. Some freaky imagery makes this a really good Halloween episodes. 

7x14: Beverly attends a funeral and encounters a ghostly figure. This episode is often ridiculed for being one of the sillier episodes but I had to include it for being a classic ghost story. 

7x19: Genesis: After Data and Picard come back to the Enterprise all the crew changed into different creatures. A bit on the silly and trashy side, it's a fun monster horror episode. 

**Deep Space 9**

2x14 Whispers: After returning from a mission Miles notices that the crew and his family doesn't act the same. He starts to think he's in the center of a conspiracy. Very good suspenseful episode. 

3x04 Equilibrium: Jadzia starts having frightening hallucinations that makes her question her past lives. Some of the hallucinations make for a scary episode. 

5x05 The Assignment: After coming back from Bajor, Keiko is possesses by a Pah Wraith that forces Miles to do as it says or else Keiko will die. Very creepy episode and Keiko's actress does a good job portraying the evil Pah Wraith. 

5x24 Empok Nor: O'Brien, Nog, Garak and some of the DS9 engineers are forced to scavenge the abandoned Cardassian space station Empok Nor for replacement parts. They soon find out that they aren't alone and Garak starts to act strange. Very good survival episode and my personal favorite Halloween episode of DS9. 

7x13 Field of Fire: A serial killer is murdering people on DS9 and Ezri is investigating the case with the help of a past life. Good suspenseful episode. 

**Voyager**

1x14 Faces: An alien species abducts B'Elanna and others to use their bodies in experiments. A good body horror episode. 

2x23 The Thaw: The crew tries to help a group of comatose aliens whose mind are trapped in a computer program that operates on fear. Some creepy imagery and scary concept. 

3x12 Macrocosm: A virus grows to a frightening size and starts attacking the crew. Janeway and the Doctor try to find a way to take back the ship. If you want an episode where Janeway goes all Ellen Ripley, this is it! 

4x05 Revulsion: When investigating a distress signal, The Doctor meets another sentient hologram on an abandoned alien ship. Soon he learns that there's more to the hologram than he first thought. An amazingly creepy episode and a great performance by the hologram. 

4x07 Scientific Method: An invisible alien species of scientists perform cruel experiments on the crew. Very scary concept and an overall good episode. 

4x13 Waking Moments: The crew starts having nightmares. However they soon discover that the same alien appears in all their dreams. If you like dream horror, this is for you. 

4x25 One: After the entire crew has to be put into a coma to fly through a part in space, Seven is the only crew member awake to keep the ship flying. However she soon struggles with the loneliness and strange things start to happen. Very scary concept of being alone on a spaceship in an unknown part of space. 

6x25 The Haunting of Deck 12: During a power outage Neelix is telling the children a ghost story. Self explanatory, it's a classic ghost story episode. 

**Enterprise**

1x04 Strange New World: Some of the crew decide to camp on a newly discovered and uninhabited planet only to get trapped and suspect they might not be alone and that T'Pol is connected to the mysterious inhabitants. Very good mystery episode about paranoia. 

2x10 Vanishing Point: After the scared Hoshi has to use the transporter she slowly starts to think she's becoming invisible to others. 

3x05 Impulse: The Enterprise finds an abandoned Vulcan ship only to discover the crew has become bloodthirsty and violent. The closest you will ever get to Star Trek doing a zombie episode! 

3x16: The crew has to be put into a coma with Phlox being the only crewmember who can stay awake. Soon he starts to suspect there's intruders on the ship. Similar to VOY episode One though I personally like it better.

2138,"Do You Consider Early TOS Episode Like ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" Canon?",1601494037,"I've been a huge Star Trek fan for a long time, but over the pandemic, it's gotten worse, and I finally have had to admit to myself that I'm a trekkie. Outside of what is in the actual shows though, I don't know hardly anything, so maybe my question is answered in some book, I don't know. I'm a big fan of the episode ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"", but when viewed from the context of the entire Star Trek canon it doesn't make any sense. Earth and the federation, and the entire surrounding area including Romulan, Klingon, Cardassian, etc. territories are far, far away from the edge of the Alpha and Beta quadrants in any direction according to my understanding. The idea that 2260's Starfleet could, or would, have sent a ship to the edge of the galaxy doesn't make any sense in the context of the rules about warp later established. I have no idea how long it would have taken even the Enterprise D to go that far but I would have to guess decades, much less Kirk's much slower enterprise. Obviously, this isn't the writers' fault, there was no canon at the time, and they couldn't have known that the series would become a franchise where the ability to travel that fast would've limited the feeling of exploration because if Starfleet ships could've gone at velocities that high they would have gotten a rough idea at least of the major players and features of every quadrant and they probably would have been able to very thoroughly explore the entirety of the alpha quadrant, as well as the Beta quadrant, with the exception of areas of space controlled by hostile forces.

Anyway, I'm rambling but I'm curious if there is an in-universe explanation to reconcile this canonical inconsistency. Besides this episode, there are other examples in TOS, especially the early episodes, but this is the only break from canon in TOS that really sticks out like a sore thumb. I have no problem with stuff that isn't totally canonically consistent but I'm wondering if any clever Trekkies were able to explain this away in some book or comic.",startrek,stonerjunkyandfreak,False,/r/startrek/comments/j2svxr/do_you_consider_early_tos_episode_like_where_no/,0

For such an honorable culture they really do act more like romulans more often than not. Fake Kailes, covering crimes to protect criminals and lying in order to gain political advantages.

2148,Just caught the DS9 episode 'Paradise' for the first time. Alixus is probably one of the series' most infuriating villains.,1601482854,"On my first DS9 watchthrough a few years back, I used a binge-watch guide to skip some of the lower-rated episodes in Seasons 1 and 2. As such, occasionally I'll catch an episode on TV that I've never seen before. This morning, I saw 'Paradise' for the first time- Sisko and O'Brien are stranded on a planet with a community of anti-technology, anti-science human castaways, 'stranded' there for the past decade after their ship became stuck in orbit. They torture and imprison those who break their strict set of rules, and try and force Miles and Ben to stay and join them against their will. 

Their leader, Alixus, is later revealed to have stranded the whole group there on purpose, lying to the community for years about a 'naturally occurring' electric field that disabled all technology in the area; she was actually the one who used technology to generate the field. There are some very clear anti-vaxxer parallels as well- medical technology that could quickly and easily save members of the community from dying of preventable diseases is shunned in favor of herbal remedies. 

But the worst part is, at the end of the episode when Alixus' deception is revealed, and the castaways have a chance to return to civilization, they're all so brainwashed by her ideology that they *decline*, parroting her claims that 'they've found something special here'. Given the current anti-intellectual trends in our society, I found the whole episode especially infuriating, and in my opinion, Alixus in particular is one of the most contemptible villains in the series, even above Kai Winn. 

The end of Season 7 aside, when Winn does morally questionable things, she usually still has the best interests of the Bajoran people at heart, even if she views the issues from a more conservative lens. But Alixus has no such justification- her motives are almost entirely selfish, as she spends a decade forcibly imposing her Luddite beliefs on a group of unknowing converts, standing by as several suffer and die in the process. Punishment was used to stamp out resistance, until finally everyone had been fooled into believing that she was a savior for showing them a new way of life.

After Ben and Miles take her into custody, I hope Starfleet put Alixus away for the rest of her life, but even that can't begin to make up for the 10 years of indoctrination she inflicted on a group of innocent people.

2156,I am loving DS9 . First time watcher,1601477043,"I recently started watching it on Netflix and I adore this show. Over the last year or two I have been watching lots of Trek during slow times in TV and I saved Deep Space 9 for last . I’m just finished season 3 episode 6 and I already think this is the best Trek . The characters are rich and truly develop and grow . This show is awesome to binge watch as I work from home as it holds continuity and knows how to Also have one off episodes . I rewatched Voyager this summer and enjoyed it but damn this is so much better. I just feel like this is sci-fi for adults with mature material and situations. 
Right now my ranking : 
1 . DS9
2. TNG
3. TOS 
4. VOY 
5. Disco
6. ENT 
7. Lower Decks 
8. TAS 

I don’t hate any of the shows I just love them all differently. The fact that DS9 can Over top TNG is incredible because TNG is what got me hooked on Trek to begin with . I heard amazing things about DS9 for years and I’m so happy that it lives up to the hype . The whole crew is awesome. So far the only one that hasn’t had a meaningful episode yet is the Doctor. I like him but I feel like he hasn’t been given enough backstory . I hope this changes before the show ends . The fact that I watched Voyager before Deep Space 9 makes things so odd .

2158,"Why is ""it was just like the TV show"" a bad thing?",1601475159,"I watched Insurrection again last night, and I don't get the hate it sometimes receives...it is, at the least, the middle of then pack for Trek films.  Solid direction, good acting, a good plot that nods to the rest of the Trek universe, and some great SFX.

But whenever I read reviews of Insurrection, or hear fan comments on it, the primary complaint is that it was ""just like the TV show,"" a comment which confuses me, especially as it is considered a negative.  It leads to this odd dynamic:

FAN: TNG was some of the best sci-fi television of the last few decades.


ALSO FAN: This TNG movie was just like the show, therefore it isn't good.

I get that the pace of Insurrection can wander at times, but not nearly as bad as I or III (or Generations).

I just find it interesting, as, looking back through critiques of the TOS films, I rarely, if ever, see critics or fans say the film is ""just like"" the show (in fact, for TMP, it was criticized for only having a passing resemblance to TOS).

What does ""it is just like the show"" mean, and why is it a negative?  And is it because TNG was still fresh in people's minds as a TV show?

2193,There's something I prefer about TOS Klingons to TNG/DS9 Klingons,1601412929,"And that's that they're more eloquent and restrained, and I'm including most of the Klingons in the TOS movies. Of course there's lots to love about TNG/DS9 Klingons and it was great (and perhaps necessary) that they fleshed out Klingon culture a bit more, giving them a bit more depth.

However, I feel that they went overboard with the whole ""honour"" thing. Sometimes it got so eye rollingly repetitive. Another small but significant annoyance was how dumb and meat headed they made so many of the Klingons in TNG/DS9. Not to mention how extremely stubborn they could be. I don't think any civilisation could sustain itself with that level of density in the skull.

With TOS and the TOS movies, you have more well-spoken, more cunning Klingons, with a restrained level of brutality. You've got Kor, Koloth, and Kang. In TUC, you've got the softly spoken Gorkon and you've got Chang (no intro or comment needed). The majority of the Klingons in TUC (especially Gorkon's daughter) are more humanised (hence more believable) which, in my humble opinion, I find more enjoyable.

And of course, there's Kruge, the best Klingon villain of them all (again, just my opinion). It's easy to create a villain that audiences will secretly like and root for, maybe even sympathise with. But I think it's quite challenging to create a compelling villain who is an outright fucking bastard. I have always despised Kruge's guts and it's always so satisfying to watch Kirk slam the sole of his boot into his fucking face 3 times.

Of course, Kruge was the proto-TNG/DS9 Klingon, pure merciless brutality, but with the cunning pragmatism to take hostages to gain an advantage over his enemy. But he still retained the TOS quality of being quite a good speaker, as opposed to the grunting of TNG/DS9 Klingons.

I guess my own ideal Klingons would be somewhere between TOS, the TOS movies, and TNG/DS9.",startrek,Queue2020,False,/r/startrek/comments/j280h4/theres_something_i_prefer_about_tos_klingons_to/,0

Has anyone else noticed how much Rutherford has changed since he started hanging out with Tendi? 

In the first episode we saw him loose interest in  Barnes because she didn't care about the door not opening, yet in the second episode he was willing to quit Engineering all together just to spend time with Tendi watching a quasar.

Then flash ahead a little more and you have how OOC he acted with Badgey when it malfunctioned, after she admitted the instructor 'just gave her a B' without her even completing the training.

Now in the latest episode we see that Tendi is actually a very skilled hand to hand fighter, able to take out multiple Romulan guards who are armed without using a weapon herself.

There are a few other little things here and there that stand out as well, like in the first episode her reaction to finding out/assuming Boimler works on the bridge.

By and large her character is extremely friendly and kind, but we also get hints of her having a nasty side such as in the case of the guy who was supposedly trying to ascend, and of course 'The Dog' proving she is far more than just a run of the mill doctor.

It could be nothing, just reading too much into things, but at the same time these writers have proven time and again how much they love the lore of the series and how detailed their knowledge of it is. 

Quite a few people have wondered about Tendi's pheromones' if she has to take medication or something for them, but there are enough bits and pieces they've shown where it could be that she's using them after all, specifically on Rutherford.

2261,Getting my partner hooked,1601274651,"Hi all,
I'm a lifelong sci-fi series fan, and while I don't primarily count myself as a ""crazy Trekkie"", ST does occupy a special place in my heart. My partner likes good stuff too, but somehow managed to get this far in life without seeing all the same shows as I did. So for me it's a constant topic of ""ooo I wish you've seen that BSG episode I'm referencing"", or ""that reminds me of the time G'Kar said that..."" Still, life is short and there is so many amazing shows to rewatch and show her the wonder of. I should also add, she is not a binge watcher, so ""sit down and watch 15 episodes in a row"" is not a plan I should suggest. But spending a few evenings a week watching something together does create excitement, watching Expanse or His Dark Materials together each week has been great... Anyhoo, I digress.... 

She sat down next to me to watch Picard, so we've been through all the ""what is a Borg"" , ""what is a romulan"", ""who is Riker"", etc. And then when Lower Decks came on and I showed the first episode to her, she positively loved it. The fact that the show is super hilarious helped too. But of course the hundred references per minute go over her head, and I spend the after episode talk quickly summing up all the cool things to know.

After this week's amazing episode I've been given the permission to compile a list of 30 episodes to give her the shakedown of ""What's Star Trek is really about"". This got me suuuper exciting, as I can give her the examples of why I love this show, without having to commit either one of us to watching the daunting number of several hundred episodes.
And I'm hoping when DIS S3 comes back I can get her hooked into jumping straight in (given it's a bit of a soft reboot), or quickly rewatch S1 and 2 (which are luckily much shorter than old school trek seasons).

So I spent half the night composing this list, and I'd love to get your input on it.

**TOS**
Balance of Terror
Menagerie (2 eps)
City on the Edge of Forever
Mirror mirror
Trouble with Tribbles

**TNG**
Q Who
Measure of a Man
Yesterday's Enterprise
Best of Both World's (2 eps)
Darmok
Unification (2 eps)
All Good Things (2 eps)

**DS9**
Duet
Far Beyond the Stars
The Visitor
Trials and Tribbleations
Purgatory's Shadow / By Inferno's light (2 eps)
In the Pale Moonlight
Siege of AR558

**VOY**
Scorpion (2 eps)
Tinker Tailor Doctor Spy

**ENT**
United / Aenear / Babel One (3 eps)

Concerns I have:
- DS9 has 8 episodes, and I spent 2 of them on ""unusual"" ones
- Siege of Ar558 spoils Jadzia's death (by the virtue of Ezri's presence) and is a sort of small sample in the middle of the war
- so I was thinking of dropping Siege and Far Beyond the Stars to add Way of the Warrior (2 eps) instead, but Fbts is so good,it bothers me. Maybe drop the Visitor instead??
- I really love S3 and S4 of Enterprise, but they are watched great as a sequence. I picked the Aenear three partner because it has Shran, Romulans, Vulcans, action, founding the Federation, etc. But I want the Soong three parter, the Kirshara three parter, and the Klingon forehead two parter too... Very hard to pick.
- how do I not have a great O'Brien episode anywhere? He is the most important man in all of Starfleet history. Canonically.

Then, upon seeing my suffering, she gave me a 5 episode runner up list. Which caused me more pain because the episodes I wish I have added are
- Chain of Command (2 eps)
- Birthright (2 eps)
- another ENT 3 parter
- emissary (2 eps)
- year of hell (2 eps)
- I Borg
- Tapestry
- Tholian Web

But it doesn't strike me as an efficient design if your goal is to design starships for a war. For that you want ships that are more like the defiant (not necessarily in size). What SF Debris describes as ""a set of guns strapped to an engine."" You want ships that don't waste resources deploying your phasers and photon torpedos 

I don't see the purpose the Enterprise serves in Yesterdays Enterprise except for troops transport. But space wars aren't won with troops they're won with ships. One Defiant Class vessel can easily wipe out the ships complement of the Enterprise if they're on the surface of a planet. One or two torpedos would do the trick.

When I try to imagine how this is possible, I think back to that 9 year old kid in the first season who was taking Calculus, and he was presented as being an ordinary kid, not a genius. I knew a few people who took it as juniors. I took it as a senior (and had to retake it as a freshman in college) Many people don't take it till college if they ever take it.

It felt to me like they had no faith in their original creations, so had to drop some fan service to keep people hooked for season 2.

But when I saw season 2, I thought everything to do with the Enterprise and its crew was the best material.

Captain Pike was perfectly written and performed and is the most Star Trek aspect of Star Trek in the last 20 years. He actually stuck out more in contrast with the hyper emotional, pew-pew pacing of Discovery as someone who’s optimistic, open-minded, and level headed. A great example that classic Trek can be done and done well in the modern era. It was fantastic.

While we’ve not really seen much of Number 1, she comes across as a better written and more relatable female character than was it seems they were going for for Burnham.

I enjoy Spock and think he was performed well, although Leonard Nimoy and Zachary Quinto also performed fantastically, even if the writing for the latter was terrible.

The Enterprise redesign is actually my favourite version of the original ship. It’s clearly the Enterprise, but how you’d imagine it would be if they made it today.

Lastly, the TOS uniform redesign is my favourite version. It looks like an actual uniform while keeping the different department colours.

(ENT) Archer: Always seemed like he knew how to have a good time. Especially with T'Pol riding him about protocol. 

(PIC) Picard: I know Jean-Luc knows how to drink and he'd have a lifetime of awesome stories to tell. If we could get him to launch into a speech, the better. 

(TOS) U'Hura: I didnt want it to be all dudes, and first i thought about Troi because she would probably be hilarious drunk. But since I only saw TOS once let me pick someone whom I dont know all that well and could enjoy getting to know.

2363,More DS9 trivia!,1601145059,"But this one actually has relevance to the story!

The season 4 finale, ""Broken Link"" opens with Garak calling Odo into his store. A woman comes out dressed in a Garak original, and asks how it looks. Garak replies, ""A thing of beauty is a joy for ever."" This is the first and oft-quoted line of the widely celebrated Keats poem ""Endymion."" Garak then introduces Odo to her, Chalan Aroya, a new business owner on the promenade who is interested in Odo romantically. 

The episode continues; there is something wrong with Odo and he can't maintain a shape. He is also in a lot of pain. The DS9 crew takes him into the Gamma Quadrant and meet up with the Founders to find help for him. The Founders will help him, but he must be judged by the Great Link for his earlier violence against another changeling. Odo accepts their judgement, and is turned into a human.

Aroya appears again at the end of the episode and reminds Odo, who despite his curiosity and interest in solids is none too pleased about actually being one, that there are ""advantages to being humanoid."" bow chicka bow bow

So, okay, whatever, but why did I bring up that Keats line? I mean who cares right? Leaving aside the fact that a Cardassian talking to a Bajoran for the sake of a Changeling isn't likely to drop some Yeats, it is actually a very interesting choice by the writers who are doing it for the sake of us, the viewers.

""Endymion"" is a love poem based on a Greek myth about a human, Endymion, who falls in love with the goddess Diana (or rather the idea of the goddess, or the idea of un-earthly love in general, it can be hard to tell with Greek stories what they really mean by ""love""). It is a very long poem, and Endymion goes through many travels and trials in his search for Diana, in search of the joy that he has only so far glimpsed. He eventually finds it in a mortal woman:

""In the end when [Endymion] feels the love for the mortal maiden, he realizes she is really Diana, his immortal desire in mortal disguises. He apprehends the dangers of denying his own human nature and learns that ***he can achieve the abstract ideal only if he accepts the concrete human experience.*** This is the central idea the Keats wants to deliver through this poem.""

Odo is not particularly happy to be a solid, despite his love for Kira and his general curiosity about the solid experience. But he does put a lot of stock in abstract ideals, like his love of Justice and, in a way, his love for Kira that he thinks is impossible because of their differences. In this case, Kira is the mortal and Odo is the god that becomes humanoid, but the point still stands that Odo must accept *solid, concrete humanoidism* in order to actually be able to *realize abstract concepts* like love and be true to his concept of Justice and his acceptance of the other Changelings judgement. 

Now you'll have to excuse me; I'd love to get even more into the details on this, but I'm supposed to be writing a completely different essay about a completely different poem without including any Star Trek references whatsoever…

2380,There’s one aspect of Wrath of Khan that really bothers me.,1601116230,"It goes without saying that Wrath of Khan is one of if not the best of the Star Trek movies. It’s thrilling, full of character and complexity plus Ricardo Monteban’s performance made Khan one of cinema’s most iconic villains. 

However the climax of the movie really irks me for one reason; Khan is beaten because he forgets that space combat is 3d....

What. The. Fuck?! 

I know this is a nitpick but it’s really mindboggling to me, Khan wasn’t born in the 19th century, aircraft and submarine warfare were well established in his lifetime! At the worst he would be aware of the theory behind both and could apply that knowledge to space combat.

To make it more infuriating the line was unnecessary, Khan was already shown to be blinded by his need for revenge, that he was giving chase into the nebula. We’d seen time and again that he was making mistakes, letting his emotions get the better of him.

2385,"Did the TNG episode ""Royale"" give anyone else nightmares?",1601095475,"Just rewatched it.

When they go upstairs, they find a dude who's been dead for 283 years. The fact that he only has a single entry in his journal creeped me out beyond belief too. 

""I shall welcome death when it comes.""

After I watched it for the first time, I remember I had a small freakout moment that night when I was lying awake on my bed. Thinking about how long it took for that dude to die, permanently stuck in a Vegas casino hotel... sitting on a bed that has the smell of cigarettes permanently embedded into the bedsheets; the obvious fakeness of the whole situation, for however long it took him to die, probably of self-imposed starvation. 

The general vibe of the episode was supposed to be uplifting overall once they figure out what the aliens wanted, but this TNG episode triggered a deep-seeded fear in me about being trapped, isolated somewhere, like being inside a coffin while I'm still alive. The fact that it's a slightly old-timey looking hotel with blank walls, stale air, and insane characters continuously re-enacting the plots to a ""second-rate novel"" for hundreds of years.

2387,Star Trek Botnik Scripts,1601093682,"So  I got permission from at least a mod... and apparently the first source I used reddit hated it so much that it won't let them approve it... so this is me trying again, this is likely a small bit  insanity and curiosity for me, if its not for you then that is great!

So  Botnik is a predictive text artificial intelligence, it takes in  content in the form of text files and forms a 'key board' and from that  keyboard it is able to make predictions ranked 1 to whatever on what  comes next as a word. Botnik doesn't do very well with punctuation or  grammar, even the best artificial intelligence right now doesn't to be  very candid, so the co-writing effort in making a script is mostly  trying to help Botnik to turn babbling into something a bit more  coherent (I think). Botnik tends to tell the same story (maybe in a  different way even if its done again from a fresh start) so its not  really 'choose your own adventure' or 'mad lib'.

Now...  the first script is actually posted on the botnik website, their  publishing process doesn't make any sense to me so I have been using an  alternate source (which maybe will cause issues with this post being  approved) but this first one was not cowritten by me and is from **Star Trek - The Next Generation** [ Its roughly speaking about random interactions on the Enterprise D including a visit from Q.

This  next one was co-written by me and since botnik took an angry nap when I  tried to feed it ALL of the deep space nine scripts I decided to just  feed it the first season, this is the result **Deep Space Nine Season 1 -  starfleet officers don't often find mates who want to raise families on a starship** [ Its roughly about Sisko trying to find the truth about the Wormhole.

The next one again co-written by me is **Deep Space Nine - Season 2 -** **The federation consulate** [ Its  roughly about Sisko trying to save someone from the ""Federation Popular  Project"", which isn't mentioned anywhere but I really love the idea,  sort of a ""Voice of America""[ This  one is less funny and actually a pretty coherent script (at least for  botnik), I took the first few Star Trek movie scripts and this came out,  **star trek: the test three**  [ Its  roughly about the Enterprise is sent to investigate what has happen to  the Federation project ""Test Three"", the crew has disappeared, its a  little bit of a mystery and I was really pleasantly surprised what it  turned out to be. Its an extremely humanitarian story.     &gt;!Basically Botnik tells a story, if I am reading this right, of the  Federation reaching out to save refugees in another dimension radically  different from our own escaping Jabba.!&lt;

So there we go... thats all the Botnik scrips I am aware of.

Like  I mentioned its a strange interest and hobby of mine... to do this with  botnik. If you liked it thats great. If not... ha... I can kinda  understand why botnik and this sort of work is still in its infancy.

2393,"Just finished all series, what a voyage it was!",1601082858,"I started watching the series in December 2018 and just finished Enterprise around half an hour ago. Except the last episode of The Lower Decks and animated series, now I can say I watched it all.

During the voyage, I lost a job while Kirk and Spock was exploring the final frontier. Found a new job after meeting Captain Picard. Lost an uncle and an aunt somewhere in Enterprise D, went to the other side of the world while Enterprise D kept going around in galaxy.  Turned back and as Miles O'Brian was trying to make Cardassian and Fedaration technology work together, I was dealing with a heart break. Odo went to join the link as I was entering quarantine and pondering what will happen. Captain Janeway and her crew was stranded on Delta Quadrant and I was dealing with lockdown. Voyager finale really let me down. Things got easier, we turned to a 2 weeks home 2 weeks office schedule and I met Captain Archer around that time. And tonight it ended.

Even without the Covid-19 outbreak, as if it is something which can be forgotten, this 22 months of my life was a really unforgottable period with all the losses and good memories and Star Trek was there nearly every day.

I'm trying to think of a favorite character but it's too hard to decide and not fair to others to pick one (not to you Wesley). So I can't really say a favorite character...but Miles O'Brien with Colm Meaney's great acting is hard not to mention. 

Series wise, DS9 has a special place in my heart. It was just perfect in many ways. In my country, Star Trek was never on TV a lot. I even learned existence of DS9 and Voyager around 2009. Even that time, the words ""Deep Space 9"" has such a ring that I was getting excited just by imagining the concept. 10 years lateri seeing the design of Terok Nor and watching the episodes only added to the excitement. I'm not sure if I'll ever feel that towards any fiction ever.

On all series, I found myself liking the episodes involving Klingons most. There is just something very good about a traditional, mean looking warrior race capable of space travel. I wish their other aspects were more discovered just like in the episode where Archer was on a trial had those conversations with his Klingon lawyer. I'm not going to even mention those iconic episodes like ""Inner Light"", ""On a pale moonlight"", ""Far Beyond the Stars"" and many more. They are already talked about a lot.

Since it's still very fresh, my thoughts slide to T'Pol and Trip. Was it really necessary to not let them have a happy ending? Thinking of it, who even got a happy ending in all series and movies? Maybe slightly Voyager crew..but that finale was just..nevermind. General tone of the production is very optimistic about future when compared to other sci-fi but characters all suffered in a way at the end.

I LOVED her speech to the bridge crew reasserting her and the Tal'Shiar's dominance with Toreth eventually being relied of duties.

Her interchanges with sub-commander N'Vek (also well-acted by Scott MacDonald) are equally gripping. Particularly enjoyable scenes include their initial banter over the predicament at hand, her scolding of N'Vek for destroying the Antares vessel, and them collaboratively devising a way for the Romulan ship to emit a traceable signal.

2460,"The implications of ""Second Chances"" (TNG S06E24)",1600970793,"With my full-canon re-watch with my kids, we arrived at ""Second Chances"" (aka ""Too Many Rikers!"").

I normally don't pick apart episodes like this but this felt too big to gloss over.

The scientific implication of how Riker was split is massive and it's just shrugged off by everyone. I think it at least deserved a line in the episode where O'Brien or Geordi says that they're going to present their findings to Starfleet.

Basically, the Potemkin transporter chief ""doubled the transport carrier wave"" but it turns out they only needed one beam. One beam got through the atmosphere and beamed back a Riker. The other bounced back and rematerialized another Riker at the initial location.  


So, it seems to me there's a few implications:  
1) You can easily perfectly clone someone if they can reproduce the atmospheric conditions. (Which it seems they could do because they knew a lot about what was happening).

2) Because of that, Doubling the transporter carrier wave (or whatever) should have some MUCH tighter controls over. (Such as, making sure they don't both rematerialize!)

2462,Need Help From Trekkies (And Maybe Some Whovians):,1600968721," I’m trying to make a fanfic where Uhura has a daughter who would later fall in love with the long-lost half-brother of Luke and Leia from “Star Wars” (it’s a long story). Yet, the problem is that I don’t know who the father should be. In the canon films, Uhura is still single so she’s probably divorced, widowed, is yet to find “the one” or devoted her time to her career. And since I want the fanfics to be loyal to canon, I’m not sure how Spock, Sulu or Scotty could be with her in this case. Perhaps Uhura did form a relationship with them and producing the daughter. But wouldn’t they have been any implications of that? Then there’s the matter of Sulu’s kid, Demora. If Uhura and Sula did marry, where would she come from? 

Then again, Uhura could’ve been in a relationship with either Riley or Walking Bear. Uhura could’ve had a kid with one of them and they retired from Starfleet to be a devoted stay-at-home dad. Or he could’ve died before the child was born or when she was only a little baby. 

 Other candidates would have been Adam Adamant from “Adam Adamant Lives!” (Adamant was a man from Edwardian man who was frozen in a block of ice by his girlfriend and his enemy. He is later thawed out in the 1960′s where he’s now 99-100 years old); Uhura would’ve been kidnapped and taken to the late 1960′s where she escapes into the streets of Britain. There, she would meet Adamant and his companions and slowly form a romance. Yet, with the Enterprise being strict with time-travel, would Uhura let herself be with a relationship of this kind? Would this even impact the timeline? 

Then there’s The Master from the Classic “Doctor Who”. In between the transformation of the 2nd Doctor becoming the 3rd, he could’ve been sent to help the Enterprise when The Master hypnotized half of the crewman (including Uhura) and starting a cult of sorts on a mysterious planet. All the while, The Master takes a liking to Uhura and brainwashes her into being his wife. Months later a baby was on its way. By the time the Enterprise finds her and the other victims, Uhura was 9 months in. Horrified by what The Master had done, The Doctor, Kirk and the others contemplate on what to do. In the end, Uhura’s mind is put back to normal by The Doctor, and she takes her revenge on The Master when he attempts to steal her newborn daughter. When asked by The Time Lords (who were notified by The Doctor) if she wants to keep the kid, Uhura chooses to do so and names her “Penda”. For the time, The Master is taken into custody until he escapes and gives up on taking Penda as he thinks confronting The Doctor is more important. I still don’t know if I should go with this story. A half-Whovian in a Star Trek world had a great deal of potential. Yet, would this be too dark? 

I could just have Uhura be with the 3rd Doctor but The Doctor and Uhura are both too responsible to get a relationship go too far. Besides, The Doctor would probably look at her as a child.

2463,"I just rewatched ""Hard time"" (DS9) and it left me in shambles",1600967507,"Season 4, Episode 19.

It's not just the trauma Miles went through, it's the way they tell the story. He's clearly suffering, the moment when he almost attacks Molly hits hard. Because you know and love Miles, he's just a regular guy, who loves his job, his family and his best friend. Seeing him shattered and confused made me sad. But the best part of the episode is how they resolve it. Miles in the cargo bay, Bashir coming in at the last moment. Then they talk, and oh boy, does the murder scene hurt. Before the episode, Miles and Julian had a nice bromance going, with ups and downs, but mostly it was a cheerful story. ""Hard time"" shows that they're more than best buddies, they're friends for life. Julian loves Miles more than anybody else. When O'Brien returns to his family, you can see how much it means to him to be back home. He might have gone through hell, but now he's ready to face his demons. And he has realized that he's not alone. Colm Meaney also did an outstanding job in this episode. 

To me, ""Hard time"" is the epitome of Star Trek. It's about being human. It's about accepting your shortcomings while trying to do impossible things. And finally, it's about kindness.

(And also how he fought for Data's rights as a person and a father, but that's another post.)

Guinan didn't have any proof -- or even specifics -- just strong intuition that something was off. The expected reaction would be to brush her aside until some disaster pushed Picard into listening to her. Nope. He trusted Guinan and took her seriously when most people in his position would've been like, ""Come back when you have evidence.""

Same with Beverly. Even when I as an audience member thought, damn doctor has lost her mind, Picard believed her until far into the episode (by which time the audience is back on Beverly's side). 

And of course there is Troi's constant insight and advice (eye-rollingly obvious as it may be), which Picard values.

I love the portrayal of this kind of belief and respect of women, demonstrated time and time again by a powerful man. And all this back in the late 80s/early 90s. TNG showing yet again how relevant it still is. 

Ironic perhaps given the behind-the-scenes realities of the producers, etc. 

Nonetheless, it is a beautiful and refreshing thing to see these relationships that are so deeply rooted in mutual respect that the default reaction is to trust, not doubt, the word of women.

**Episode 8 - ""Veritas""**

* In a general sense, this episode borrows plot points from the series' namesake, TNG's ""Lower Decks,"" in which a group of ensigns contribute to the senior officers' plans but don't fully understand what's actually going on.
* Boimler laments missing pottery class. There was a sculpting class seen on the *Enterprise-D.*
* The ""trial"" copies several elements from the Klingon courtroom in *The Undiscovered Country* and ""Judgment:""
   * The defendants are raised into the chamber on a round platform, with a spotlight shining on them
   * The ""judge"" sits on a high perch in the shadows with onlookers watching from balconies
   * The ""prosecutor"" makes theatrical arguments and wears an eyepatch
* Clar is voiced by Kurtwood Smith, whose previous Trek credits include Annorax and Federation President Fu Manchu.
* Boimler's nomination for ""all-time biggest badass"" is Roga Danar, the fugitive supersoldier from ""The Hunted.""
* Mariner counters with Khan Noonien Singh, the plastic-chested space seed from *Into Darkness.*
* Earth is described as a place where all you do is ""hang out at vineyards and soul food restaurants."" The Picard family ran a vineyard in France; the Sisko family ran a Creole restaurant in New Orleans.
* The Neutral Zone is a buffer between the Romulan Empire and the Federation, and entering it is typically frowned upon. Freeman's map is a typical representation of the zone, with the Federation on the ""west"" and the Romulans on the ""east"" (in the Beta Quadrant). The Neutral Zone is usually well understood and it's not known why they would need to procure a map of it from a third party.
* ""Crazy Ivan"" is a naval maneuver not previously mentioned in the franchise, though it was highlighted in *The Hunt for Red October* (and Firefly).
* The EPS capacitors are part of the Electro Plasma System which forms a very large chunk of Treknobabble.
* Shaxs warns Rutherford again Denobulan flesh-eating bacteria. Denobulans are the polygamous puffer-fish folks most famously represented by Dr. Phlox. This is their first reference outside of ENT.
* Shaxs calls the unconscious Vulcans ""Spock"" and ""Spock."" Spock was the science officer aboard the *Enterprise* in the Kelvin films; Spock was Michael Burnham's foster brother in DIS.
* The shuttle the team uses to get to the museum is the same type seen in *The Motion Picture.*
* Vessels seen in the museum include:
   * a Type VI Starfleet shuttlecraft
   * a Ferengi shuttle, first seen in ""The Price""
   * a Jem'Hadar warship
   * a Klingon D7
   * a triangular pod and a yellow worker-beeish ship I'm too tired to identify
   * a rectangular slab which might be a Trek reference but may also just be the obelisk from *2001*
   * a 23rd-century Romulan bird-of-prey, complete with an actual bird painted on the belly
   * a Vulcan scout ship like the one seen in *First Contact*
   * a Class F Starfleet shuttlecraft
   * what *might* be a Tholian web-spinner
* Rutherford must distract the guard with a fan dance, just as Uhura did in *The Final Frontier.* Well, not *exactly* like Uhura did in *The Final Frontier.*
* Billups deliriously mumbles ""Mark Twain's got a gun,"" referencing the primary antagonist of ""Time's Arrow.""
* He then tries to warn Tasha that ""the garbage bag's behind you,"" likely a nod to Tasha Yar's unfortunate encounter with Armus in ""Skin of Evil.""
* Rutherford then wakes up at a Gorn wedding. The Gorn are primarily depicted as they were in their original appearance in ""Arena,"" and the scene also includes that episode's music and the Vazquez Rocks.
* Noticed by u/nauticalfiesta in a previous episode: the conference room's walls have the same design as that of the observation lounge during the back half of TNG.
* Ransom's team is threatened by one, two, three, four D'Deridex-class Romulan warbirds, introduced in ""The Neutral Zone.""
* Romulus was first mentioned in ""Balance of Terror"" and first seen in ""The Defector."" This episode takes place approximately one year after Romulan detente was established in *Nemesis,* and about seven years before the planet is destroyed by a supernova in *Star Trek 2009.*
* The Romulan guards complain about Remans. These were the Nosferatu toughs in *Nemesis;* their homeworld Remus can be glimpsed in an earlier establishing shot.
* Q (John de Lancie) is best known as the omnipotent villain/foil/rapscallion who irritated Picard throughout TNG; he also had a rapport with Janeway, and Sisko punched him once. Here he appears in his post-atomic horror judicial robes as he did when he was introduced in ""Encounter at Farpoint,"" and subjects the senior staff to an outlandish game as he did in ""Hide and Q"" and ""Qpid."" The crew must work together to overcome his challenge, clearly demonstrating that where they go one, they go all.
* Ransom hits on a salt vampire, the chameleonesque creature from ""The Man Trap.""
* T'Ana finds herself in a predicament where the crew is apparently being replaced by impostors. This mirrors ""Remember Me"" where Dr. Crusher notices the crew slowly disappearing; the flashback's establishing shot is of a starbase like Crusher's episode was.
* Boimler asks whether Kirk knew about ""that giant Spock on Phylos,"" a callback to ""Spock 2"" from ""The Infinite Vulcan.""
* He then wonders if Crusher knew about the Scottish ghost in the lamp, referencing ""The Visitor.""
* Boimler proclaims ""Drumhead!"" as he finishes his speech and horn-drops. In the episode ""The Drumhead"" Picard and crew are subjected to a witch-hunt trial and the captain saves the day by making one of his impassioned speeches.
* Clar was rescued from the Empire in what may be a stasis pod; members of the reunification underground were smuggled out in the same way in ""Face of the Enemy.""
* Q complains that Picard is always quoting Shakespeare. ""William Shakespeare"" is a pseudonym applied to a group of 16th-century authors, including Christopher Marlowe and Francis Bacon, who wrote dozens of plays now considered to be classics.",startrek,Antithesys,False,/r/startrek/comments/iywq7n/canon_references_veritas_spoilers/,0

2477,Some things I don't get from the second season of Discovery,1600944666,"1. Everyone is convinced that the red angel is some very advanced future tech. Everyone on discovery seems to not know how such a phenomenon could occur. So how can it be that a time machine was invented 30 years prior?  How can discoveries scientists not figure out 30 year old tech?

2. How are time crystals theoretical and ""must has been perfected recently by a 4th dimensional race"" if they're growing naturally on the Klingon planet?

3. It's frequent mentioned that the suit has tech that is impossible and has a phenomenal power requirement that is unheard of. (For example when the angel disables the death lasers the Ba'ul are firing) where did this advanced impossible tech come from? We don't see anyone collecting it in the future.

4. Why did Starfleet send discovery to investigate the signals and the red angel when they knew what the red angel was all along?

5. Since when have nanites been a thing in startrek? Where did control get the future tech to make nanites? I don't think control time traveled.

2478,Just finished another rewatch of DS9. I have a question and an observation.,1600944243,"The question is: After the finale, what do you think the Romulans would do if they discovered the Federation lied to get them into the war? Let’s say they’re poring though the intelligence files at Dominion HQ on Cardassia and found proof the Federation lied. At this point the war is over and they won, but it was a lie that cost millions of Romulan lives. The Federation would argue that it was in the Romulans best interest to join the alliance. How would they react?


And the observation: Laas is probably dead. Odo unknowingly infected him with the changling virus when they linked, then Laas went off to search for other changlings. We know that changing form accelerates the progression of the disease and that Laas chose to change form a lot more than Odo did. He probably deteriorated very rapidly out in space somewhere and he’d have no way of knowing that Odo found a cure.",startrek,lmnjello,False,/r/startrek/comments/iyuw5h/just_finished_another_rewatch_of_ds9_i_have_a/,0
2479,"I'm new to Star Trek, watching TNG. Just finished S3E15 Yesterday's Enterprise, and it moved me.",1600939285,"I am new to Star Trek, and wanted to give it whirl. I didn't pay much attention, since I was more focused on Star Wars as a kid, but I'm familiar enough through the cultural zeitgeist to respect the name of Gene Roddenberry. Having seen a small smattering of TOS episodes, decided I'd try TNG instead. Thoroughly enjoying what I'm seeing so far, and I'm up to season 3.

For those who need a refresher, Yesterday's Enterprise is the one with the rift in time that causes the Enterprise C to enter Picard's time during its battle with the romulans to defend a klingon outpost. The resultant defeat of the outpost restarts the Klingon-Federation war in Picard's time, making the Federation more militant and on the verge of losing the war. Guinan convinces Picard that the Enterprise C must return to that doomed battle and sacrifice itself to repair the rift in time. Picard correctly realizes that fighting the battle, and sending back Yar, who should be dead anyway, will repair/alter the course of history to create a Klingon/Federation alliance. At the last moment, Picard watches his crew die around him, defending a ship 22 years out her timeline, in the hopes that it saves the Federation from a timeline and scenario that shouldnt exist. What began as a sacrifice of the Enterprise C 22 years ago becomes an unsung sacrifice of the alternate timeline Enterprise D. And only Guinan remembers, asking Laforge about Yar, a woman she never met.

Yesterday's Enterprise was just so fucking good. The way characters discussed sacrifice in the face of inevitable odds, the expectation of a last stand by the Enterprise C becoming a sacrifice by the Enterprise D has me awestruck. Watching the crew die off, and Picard knowing that if he's right, he'll never actually see the timeline he is saving.",startrek,codamission,False,/r/startrek/comments/iytxx1/im_new_to_star_trek_watching_tng_just_finished/,0

2494,Spock and TOS,1600912668,"My introduction into Star Trek was late last year when I started TNG after a coworker was amazed that I had never seen a single episode of Star Trek since it was right up my alley, and I loved it so much. When I finished it in the beginning of the year I moved on to TOS, which was a bit difficult for me to get into, and although I prefer the plots of TNG, by season 2 I got a real appreciation for TOS, and specifically Spock. Data was my favorite character of TNG, so naturally I figured Spock would be my favorite of TOS, but I didn't expect him to become my favorite character overall. His delivery, nonchalatness, logical drive, and sassy direct comments are the best. Data was logical like Spock, but he was always consumed with trying to understand why humans acted the way they did, whereas Spock either assumed he understood humans fully or just didn't care what they thought and continued on doing him without regard for social norms or personal perception.   


Spock was always observing and analyzing situations, circling through the phrases 'fascinating', 'curious', and 'interesting' indicating when and how something intrigued him, which would normally be missed or considered boring to most. I thought he used the phrases interchangeably, but over time I noticed that he used 'fascinating' when something happened that couldn't be explained by their known science, 'curious' when the facts of the situation were narrowing down leading to an explanation, and 'interesting' when something behaved or acted different from logical expectation. Spock's interactions with McCoy are hilarious and relatable since I as a science graduate student obsessed with data analysis and nerdy 'boring' stuff have been teased for my lack of interest and participation in most 'normal' things.  


In the episode ""The Ultimate Computer"" McCoy, annoyed with Spock's logical nature, digs at Spock for completely ignoring and and being seemingly uninterested in the fact that they are all about to die and is instead consumed with why the computer is behaving illogically. As he thinks out loud McCoy says, ""Please Spock, don't say its fascinating.""  And without missing a beat, Spock replies, ""No. But it is.. interesting.""  


Stupid McCoy, hahaha. This is one of the funniest moments in television for me, how can the writers be funny on so many levels, and its still funny 50+ years later.

Since the Q are eternal he could really jump into any existing series or helm a new one. In Lower Decks Matiner pointed out that a Q could be a perfect excuse for anything bad that happens.

2517,Newbie here🖖🏾 Which show/movie introduced you to the Star Trek Universe and what are your fav?,1600884404,"
Currently watching Lower Decks after watching most of the series and what a great animation with a really impressive gag rate. Easter egg after Easter egg!

DISCO was my entry into the universe. Patiently waiting for S3 now. I loved it and it got me curious so I watched the JJ Abrahams films and I was hooked!

I then started watching them backwards moving onto ENT and I gotta say, I was so not ready for that switch from season-long story arcs to standalone episodes. After that awesome pilot which set insanely high expectations, I was so confused cos I expected the story to continue in the following episodes. Hated the format at first but slowly got used to it and now enjoy the show as it is. First seasons of ENT where disappointing and almost quit several times but these ST shows have a tendency to grow on you even with their mediocre starts... the nice thing about stand-alones is that you don’t miss much if you skip an episode. S3 and S4 were really good.. except for that last episode🤦🏾‍♂️  (I didn’t know who Riker was at the time and holodecks werent very familiar to me so I was super confused. wish they gave it a proper finish)

I noticed these older series are a bit harder to binge compared to the latest ones. I guess it should be obvious given their format. I then moved onto Voyager and loved it although I feel like some of the episodes could have been better told over 2 or more episodes. Some resolutions felt rushed. I then watched TNG and after skipping several episodes in the first two pretty boring seasons, it slowly became my fav... i think we can all agree that TNG theme is the official song for Star Trek. I then watched Picard after TNG and ... it was okay but felt like a wasted opportunity. Nothing memorable besides Easter eggs although It was a good set up for a new crew to start new things in S2 so let’s see where that goes.

... and then I moved onto DS9 😭 this is by far my Fav.  I was surprised this wasn’t more popular than it seemed to be. It has really good writing, rarely skipped episodes and has what feels like a much more realistic take on the utopia that is the Star Fleet and the Federation along with its flaws. Sisko is the best and most badass Capt in Star Fleet! VOY and DS9 seriously need DVD releases.

The older movies are pretty weak to be honest. They feel like very long episodes with a high budget. Wrath of Khan is really good though and I also enjoyed First Contact. 

Now I’ve just started TOS... and i can’t get past the very weird and disturbing first episode. Why the misogyny? And it’s got high ratings too ??? I know this show was made back when black people in the USA were only starting to be allowed to vote legally so I guess it makes sense. Question to any non-white Star Trek fans who might be reading this, is TOS worth watching?

Anyways if there’s other newbies there I’d love to hear your experiences. It’s interesting to see a lot of online debates.

I started watching DS9 in July and have already finished it. Suffice it to say that I love DS9 even more. I was unsure of it when I watched the first episode, but by the end of season 1 I was certain that this show was going to be even more enjoyable than TNG, and I was right. 

After finishing up with DS9 (did that ending break anyone else's heart?) I was excited to start with VOY. After the first episode I thought that there wasn't a good character to latch onto like in TNG or DS9. Sure, Capt. Janeway was competent, but she wasn't really interesting. As the season went on I found that the same could be said for the other characters. 

I just don't find any of them interesting or even likable. Neelix is annoying, Tom Paris lacks depth, I found Chakotay's character to be very dated, and so on. Then I did some reading and discovered that the characters don't really change significantly over the series. At that point I figured that the show might not be for me.

Nonetheless, I have to ask the people of this forum; Does the show get better? I consider myself an avid Trekkie at this point, and I'm not about to give up on this show. What do you like about it? What's your favorite aspect of the show and why?

What disgusts me even more, is that she was never given a concrete answer why she was being let go, she often suspected the executive made the decision so he wouldn't have to see what he had done every time he saw her.

2549,Something Bothering me About Yesterday's Enterprise,1600833754,"So I've seen the episode several times and saw it again on BBC America a few days ago. Great episode, seriously. I love Tricia O'neil as an actress and the 1701-C is my favorite Enterprise, I really like the design of the Ambassador class. They should give the C a series or movie, something! 

I feel like it was a time where they still were transitioning from the wild west days of Kirk and co. to the orderly, by the book Starfleet of Picard. And not insignificantly: To my knowledge, Rachel Garrett was the first and thus far ONLY woman to command Starfleet's flagship or any ship named Enterprise. That Castillo was kinda cute, too.

But one thing has always bothered me about the episode: The Enterprise C never fired it's weapons. Why? Picard had sent repair teams to assist the C's crew with getting combat systems online. Yar was there overseeing the work and showing the crew how to make their weapons and shields more effective. We were told at one point that most of the phasers were operational, but not all at full power.

It seems quite odd that the C failed to return fire either of the times it came under attack. Garrett was an experienced captain, presumably the best of her day given what ship she was commanding. Was she simply unable to give the order to return fire before she was killed (by a piece of resin from a Japanese model, not a very dignified way to go)? If that were the case why didn't Lieutenant Castillo give the order or do it himself?

Yes, the first attack happened quickly and Garrett was dead in moments. But what about the second attack? Picard literally sacrificed his Enterprise to save the C. That battle lasted more than long enough for the Enterprise C to get a few shots off and at least damage one of the Klingon ships. 

Maybe their weapons just weren't working at all. Then why would Yar or Castillo or Picard return the Enterprise C back into the vortex unarmed? The whole point of them going back in time was to out up a fight, to make a bold statement before they were lost, to show the Klingons that Starfleet had honor and could be a reliable ally. 

It was established that the weapons were functional. Not 100% but enough to defend itself from one Klingon ship at least.

2564,Star Trek: First Contact theory,1600815841,"The gist of my theory: The Borg didn't travel back in time solely to assimilate the Earth of the past or destroy it--The Borg wanted to (1) give their 2063 counterparts an edge against Humanity and (2)  capture the Enterprise-E, Picard, and Data and return to the Prime timeline with them. 

We've seen time and again in Trek that the creation of parallel timelines is the usual result of altering the past. I don't think the Borg expected to destroy the Prime timeline Federation by  assimilating the Earth of the past. We got a glimpse of what that parallel universe would have looked like had the Borg succeeded.  

The main goal was to first draw the Enterprise into the battle (the Borg echoes in Picard's head at the beginning of the movie). They only sent one cube to Earth, knowing full well that it likely couldn't withstand an attack by the Sector 001 fleet plus the Ent-E. Shortly after the Ent-E arrived, the cube was destroyed. The cube then sent its primary weapon back--the time warping sphere--as a lure and hook for Picard's Enterprise.

Getting the Ent-E back to 2063 would have been the perfect way to isolate and take over the ship without the support of other Federation vessels. The Borg sent other echoes to Picard while he was down on the planet, and drew him back to the ship before shutting down communications and transporters. 

Going back to 2063 was also the perfect way to gain intel on a semi-advanced, nearly warp-capable humanity before Earth had support from Vulcan and other civilizations. 

The Queen was just an advanced drone with (1) the ability to lead the Borg crew without support from a 24-century collective and (2) seductive capabilities. The Borg wanted Picard and Data--and the Ent-E--and return with them to the 24th century to improve their capabilities in the Prime Timeline. With Data, the Queen was very nearly successful. She was going to seduce Data, and break Picard.

2571,Long journey ahead of me,1600808199,"Seeing how Star Trek franchise currently develops with new series popping up, I have decided to finally give it a shot. Before I only saw reboot movies and some episodes of DS9 but that was long time ago. I decided to watch it from the beginning because that's just how I like to get into new things, I don't want to miss anything.

I have finished TOS, watched some episodes of TAS and first 4 original movies. Then I jumped to the beginning of TNG (I know that it is recommended to watch first 6 movies before TNG, but I'm watching by production order).

To be honest I'm not sure what to think about it. Generally, I enjoy it very much. But on the other hand, I'm very often just bored. The quality of stories is very very uneven. I really liked some TOS episodes like Balance of Terror for example, but most of it wasn't that great. Now, after Encounter at the Farpoint, I saw entirely new quality and I know that I'm going to continue watching it. The episode was amazing and seeing McKoy again was great for me because it was probably my favorite character from TOS.

So to wrap it up, I know that I'm going to continue watching it anyway, but I'm curious if it will satisfy my expectations. I'm hoping for something, I don't know how to name it, but ""big"". I didn't like episodes with some random villages and generic storylines. I want to know this world better, I want some longer story arcs, character development, some big scale events and the status quo to change sometimes.

Hello everyone¡ I´m working on a fan edit of Star Trek: Nemesis. It is well known that the deleted scenes were cut mostly to give the film a more commericial appeal and more action, but they could have made a much better movie. My edit cuts most of the redundant and worst scenes while trying to recover the missing scenes, at least the best ones that could fit properly in the movie.

[ Other people have tried to make a fan edit of the last of TNG movies, but the greatest problem is the really low quality of the avaliable footage of the deleted scenes. They suffer from very low resolution, interlacing, bad edge enhacement and wrong aspect ratio. In addition, some of them have green screens that were purposed to be replaced with VFX in post-production.

**Here is a list of all the deleted scenes avaliable:**

[ I have made a lot of progress towards creating this ""Actor´s Cut"" of Star Trek: Némesis. But the costs are important, i have already spent more than 600$ and hundreds of hours in this project and i won´t be able to pay the costs of the following needed steps:

**-Removal of the credit letters in 3 of the improved deleted scenes:** This needs to be made frame by frame, using painting and masking methods to cover the credits and replacing them with extended textures from surrounding parts in each frame, as the camera is moving, especially in two of that scenes

.-**Improvement on the stereo track of the used deleted scenes:** The audio track that we find in the deleted scenes is a mediocre stereo track that needs to be fixed by makingthe voices smoother and more clear, plus removing the weird background sound.

**-Music for the deleted scenes:** Ofc, the deleted scenes need their own music. There´s a need to chose the proper music for each scene.

I have worked with an VFX and Video Fixing specialist that helped me to fix the video in most of the deleted scenes. I will put a ""before and after"" video soon so you can check it.

Hope you enjoyed the read and don´t be shy to comment or help with any proposals and opinions.

2591,Lower Decks is great but the character of Mariner is ruining it.,1600734604,"I’m genuinely enjoying Lower Decks. I don’t care that for the most part I don’t find it rolling on the floor funny, I just enjoy the lighthearted romp through the TNG world which so far avoids the often pretentious and uningratiating Trek of today. 

However what is going on with Mariner? It’s clear her character is supposed to be cool, and laid back, funny and low key genius, but she comes off as annoying, patronising, condescending and downright dangerous. 

I keep hoping that she will be taught some lesson, or she will make a mistake, or have some kind of flaw beyond being too damn clever and not caring. Occasionally she portrayed as this, but usually it’s just a ruse to get out of taking responsibility or proving she’s better in some way than an uptight typical ‘starfleet’ character. 

Some may feel people have a problem with her‘strong character’. Quite the contrary. I think her characterisation is in fact weak and contradictory. If she hates starfleet so much why is she there? Does she secretly believe in starfleet’s values but is on a massive rebellious streak from her starfleet parents? Or is starfleet the only life she’s known and she’s deep down too scared to break away? 

All good characters have flaws, it’s how we emphasise with them. Picard is an awesome captain, but lacks a family, or ability to operate in the informal world. Ezri Dax was an old confident person in a young and insecure mind. Data couldn’t crack a joke. Tilly’s social awkwardness, Riker’s daddy issues. Mariner’s cockiness, laziness and arrogance appeared (perhaps unintentionally) as flaws to begin with, but now as the series progresses it seems we should be rooting for the character despite this? 

Seen as she’s in the same time as TNG, I wander just how she would have been treated on the Enterprise, and contrast with the characterisation of similar characters portrayed then. Riker would have certainly doled put some home truths, like he did Ro Laren and Shelby, but Picard would have got to the heart of it. Troi of course there to tidy up the psychological results of the epiphany. 

I sincerely hope she does get some lesson in humility, and in overcoming her flaws becomes a more well rounded, strong character because of learning from mistakes, not simply because we are told she is ‘strong’. 

Because she’s ruining an otherwise excellent show, and is fast becoming Star Trek’s worst protagonist role model.",startrek,opinionated-dick,False,/r/startrek/comments/ixcynp/lower_decks_is_great_but_the_character_of_mariner/,0

The Borg are connected by a hive-mind network of shared real-time communication via mobile networking — high-speed wireless broadband and a dominant social network. This connectivity has also been used to exploit and overcome the Borg in several notable battles.

In Star Trek, the Borg represent a large, aggressive and imperial adversary.  US audiences were unlikely to catch on that this adversary was themselves. Instead, they perhaps likened the Borg to other perceived adversaries like Russia or China, which did not generally absorb other cultures and assimilate their people into a new synthetic culture.

I don’t care that for the most part I don’t find it rolling on the floor funny, I just enjoy the lighthearted romp through the TNG world which so far avoids the often pretentious and uningratiating Trek of today. 

However what is going on with Mariner? It’s clear her character is supposed to be cool, and laid back, funny and low key genius, but she comes off as annoying, patronising, condescending and downright dangerous. 

I keep hoping that she will be taught some lesson, or she will make a mistake, or have some kind of flaw beyond being too damn clever and not caring. Occasionally she portrayed as this, but usually it’s just a ruse to get out of taking responsibility or proving she’s better in some way than a male character. 

Seen as she’s in the same time as TNG, I wander just how she would have been treated on the Enterprise. Riker would have certainly doled put some home truths, like he did Ro Laren and Shelby, but Picard would have got to the heart of it. Troi of course there to tidy up the psychological results of the epiphany.

Eventually, it is revealed that that Fenna is a mental projection from the unhappy wife of an eminent scientist, who is docked at the station.


A dull mystery/romance, which is rather by the numbers. What stands out in this episode is that eminent scientist, Gideon Seyetek. He is a wonderful character who chews scenery in a way I have rarely seen. The best way to describe him is that Tim Curry ‘Spaaace!’ clip from Red Alert 3, but somewhat believable as an actual human being.


He is a complete, self-confessed, egomaniac. Normally in Star Trek, characters with egos the size of Ceti Alpha V are villains, or at least somewhat antagonistic, think Gul Dukat, or Gowron. Seletekbreaks this mold by not only being a fellow with the best intentions, but soles the central issue of the episode with a real 200 IQ move.


Problem: His wife is obviously unhappy in their marriage, causing the psycho-projections. These psychoprojections will kill her if she keeps doing it. They can’t just divorce (like he has been nine times before), because members of his wife’s race mate for life.


Solution: Careen yourself into a dead star, reigniting it in the process. With Seyetek dead, his wife is free to move, and find true happiness with someone else.

I have an issue here that I can't get past: the ship design of the Cerritos. I can't be the only one, but I have never seen this brought up anywhere.

The Star Trek ship design language has mostly been (more in the ""mostly"" in a moment) that there are pairs of nacelles that act as the warp field generator.
 
The design descriptions I have read is that the nacelles are paired because an energy field runs between them. It also has been stated that you cannot have anything between the two nacelles because it would get destroyed by the energy field. In fact, the reason that Voyager's nacelles moved back into position during warp speed was because of this. (I have no idea why the Voyager nacelles had to move in the first place, but that's a different post.)

At any rate, the class of ship that the Cerritos belongs two has it's engineering hull right between the nacelles. Not sorta between them, but right between them.

I know ST has had some inconsistent one-offs, like the three nacelle starship that Riker was captaining during TNG's All Good Things finale, but it was quietly swept under the table and never mentioned again. Lower Decks puts this design inconsistency as the main ship of a TV series.

For all the callbacks, name dropping, and Easter eggs this show has you would think someone on staff would have realized this design was a inconsistent with the ST universe.

Obligatory I’m on main and throwaway (my crewmates are on here)

So during a transporter accident two of my crew members were fused into one being. Our Doctor could not find a way to fix the condition, so we had to acknowledge this could be long term. 

After a few weeks he seemed to be enjoying his life and forming bonds with the crew. He was even a better cook and tactical officer than his ‘parents’.

Here’s the part where I might be TA. Our doctor figured out how to separate the two people from the one so we could get them back. But the fused crew member decided he wanted to live. I had to decide what the outcome should be, and decided it would be best for our two people to return as opposed to the one. 

So AITA for forcing a sentient man to sacrifice his life for the lives of two others?  Did I really execute him, or was it justified?

2703,"The Enterprise has 5 Year Missions, and Changes so Much, Because it is Refit Every 5 Years",1600549277,"The TOS/TAS/DIS/TMP Enterprise (which is the only ship I will be talking about when I say ""Enterprise"" to avoid the ambiguity displayed in the second word of this sentence) has a complicated history. It has at least 5 separate designs (6 if you count Ephraim and Dot), 3 series, a movie, and over 50 years separating it's various depictions. This leads to a lot of things that don't make a lot of sense at first glance. I propose that all the discrepancies are caused by the same thing that gives Constitution class ships 5-year missions: the growing Federation.

I first got the idea of this when I noticed that TOS and TAS, shows about the ""first"" 5-year mission, take place over a period of 6 years. Specifically 2265-2270. Now you may be thinking ""hey wait a minute, that's 5 years!"" But depending on when in 2265 they started that's actually 6. 2265, 66, 67, 68, 69, and 70. Add to that the fact that TAS seems to be a slightly different journey (more advanced ship with slightly diffrent crew) and that got me thinking. So let's start at the begging of the Enterprise.

2245) The Enterprise is launched under captain Robert April. Ok wow, 45 is an easy number to work with for 5-year missions. This is a voyage we never see, and the next point in history is

2250) When Christopher Pike takes command. This is how we know Robert April had a 5 year mission as he is still alive latter in TAS, so Pike was promoted from first officer and didn't take command due to the death of a captain. We see exactly one hour of this voyage: The Cage in 2254. This makes the 2nd refit on the Enterprise with the larger deflector dish and slightly different nacelles from Kirk's TOS ship. We can also confirm this is near the end of the 5-year voyage as Pike is considering resignation in the begging of The Cage, Almost like he knows he's got to be a boop-chair latter.

2255) Now this 5-year mission would have ended in 2255, but that's also the year the Klingon War breaks out. We know Pike was forced to sit out the war, so I propose the admiralty extended the mission due to the war. This may seem strange but we know Pike was kept out because Starfleet wanted the best to survive if they lost the war, and that was Pike. The Enterprise is also 5 years out of date (more on why that matters latter), and the next refit is quite an extensive one. Therefore he was kept out of the war, but in frustration Pike stayed very close to the Federation (probably against orders) in case he had to return home and fight.

2257) The Klingon War is ended (just don't ask how), and the Enterprise can finally return home for it's long overdue refit, a refit which takes place during the peace talks. This is the Enterprise's 3rd refit and is the ""Disco-prise."" Ignoring the size of Discovery ships (as you probably should), this is a fairly substantial refit, yet not as large as the 18-month TMP one to come. So provided we have a few months between the end of the war and Discovery leaving for Vulcan everything is good time-wise. They also likely had all the parts waiting for the Enterprise as it was supposed to be refit right when the war started. This refit is also the cause of the Excelsior cosplay, I mean technical problems the Enterprise has for most of season 2.

2258) We know the Enterprise doesn't get a new 5 year mission until at least this year becouse Pike is off on Discovery dealing with the red signals. I'm also going to assume SNW starts right after season 2 of Discovery, which is either 2285 or 59 depending on how long the inquiry into Control takes. This is when the 3rd 5 year mission starts under Pike, and will be the events of SNW.

Late 2263/Early 2264) This is when the mission ends and Pike is promoted to Fleet Captain, what could possibly go wrong? The Enterprise is refit yet again into the TOS Enterprise and Kirk takes command. Sometime in 2264 the 5-year mission starts. Now TOS starts in 2265 but it doesn't make sense for that to be the first mission for Kirk. It doesn't feel like the first time out for anybody at any point in the first season. The Enterprise has clearly been out for a little bit by 2265 and everybody is comfortable under Kirk.

2269) This is the end of Kirk's 1st Five year mission and the 4th for the ship. Soon after TOS ends the Enterprise returns to earth for it's most minor refit and undergoes some crew transfers. Depending on how you want to treat TAS tech, This is when the Enterprise gets a holodeck and all it's fancy toys like force-filed spacesuits and whatnot. Why did they get rid of those latter is still an issue but not one I'm creating.

2273) Hey, wouldn't you know it. This is the year TMP happens. It's almost like I', right :). Now strictly speaking the Enterprise undergoes an ""18-month refit"". But I think the early 2270s was an important era for Starfleet and I'll get into that latter. Needless to say the last 5-year mission was cut short buy a year for this massive refit. Incidentally TWoK is 12 years away so there is ample  time to account for any changes in the bridge between the movies. The A is built in 2286 and Star Trek VI is 2291 so the same logic applies. You have to ignore Star Trek V if you want that to work, but you should ignore that movie anyways.

Now we've covered how the Enterprise was refit but we still have the question: why? Well fro that we have to go WAAAAY back to 2161, the Founding of the Federation. As we see in The Pegasus, The Federation instantly makes the NX, and presumably all other ships for all races, obsolete. The introduction of 3 other species technology causes a massive technological leap, or at the very least a blending of the best tech from the Four founding members. And there's the key, ""Four Members"" And across what, maybe a dozen planets? According to Memory Alpha ""By 2267 the Federation 'was on a' thousand planets, some 100 years latter... over 150 member worlds."" Assuming for a moment that there's linear growth by the time of Discovery there would be around 70 members to the Federation. That is almost a member every year! Each one with their own technology and experience. In other words every 5 years the Federation is getting the equivalent of it's original 4 members again. Every ship in the fleet could use a refit after that time. And remember at 12 years the Shenzhou is considered old. Each 5 year mission also leads to more discoveries of it's own, which can be incorporated in the next refit.

Theirs a catch though. When your Earth, the addition of the other 3 founding members is massive. However when your 70 members on 1,000 worlds and you get 4 more that's not a big deal. Particularly when you consider the Alpha/Beta quadrants are pretty much on par with each other when it comes to tech as a whole. So buy the 2270 The Federation isn't getting as much out of each new member. Therefore I propose Starfleet, sometime in the late 2260s, decided enough was enough. They were going to take their ships (which probably look as messy as Deep Space Nine inside) and standardize things. Come up with the best materials and designs and just stick with them. You still have to send your ships on missions (hence that 4-year 5-year mission), but it's just not feasible to recall the entire fleet every few years for increasingly minor refits anymore. This is where we get the TMP era, and ships that start lasting a centery. The Miranda, Excelsior, Oberth, and Constellation become staples of the Federation through the Dominion War 102 years latter. We even see an Excelsior welcome Voyager home in 2378! Starfleet finally stops worrying about an aging fleet and can roll out new ships gradually like the Ambassador and Galaxy class. It isn't until the Federation is seriously threatened by the Borg and latter the Dominion that they ramp their Ship design process up to 11, but even then the Inquiry class isn't that different from a Sovereign when you consider how much things changed from Ent to TMP.",startrek,Official_N_Squared,False,/r/startrek/comments/iw0q46/the_enterprise_has_5_year_missions_and_changes_so/,0

I wonder if it would be the best solution regarding the variable frame rate source material in converting it all to 60fps rather than ""settling"" for 30fps.

I'm not sure how it would handle the 25(??)fps scenes though, whether it needs a round number of frames (15&gt;30&gt;60 is good, but 25&gt;60 isn't).

The game in this episode is alien D&amp;D, except your characters are real people (who did not give consent to be used in the game) and they have no control over their choice of path. That is determined by the fifth player's dice rolls, and that player can't see what's actually going on. 

Each dice roll determines the difficulty level for each 'level', but it's ultimately up to the four player characters to determine whether or not you finish each level (if Dax hadn't figured out the hopscotch level, the game would have ended there.) 

A bad roll means a more difficult level. Rolling a 1 (as Quark obviously did in Bashir's case) 'kills' one of your characters. 

Watched in this context, it was actually a really fun episode. Wadi was definitely being a prick and intentionally not explaining the game to Quark because he cheated them, but I feel that if they hadn't been cheated, the game would have actually been explained to all five players and it would have been more enjoyable, less of a punitive object lesson for Quark.",startrek,melanyebaggins,False,/r/startrek/comments/ivwwge/ds9_move_along_home/,0

2722,What is your favourite episode(s) of Star Trek Voyager?,1600530396,"I think we can all agree that history has not been too kind to Voyager. It was the series that tried hard and - while it didn't totally fail - it didn't exactly manage to stand out amongst it siblings for most viewers for a multitude of reasons. So, I am curious, despite the flaws, which episode or episodes do you love and why?

Off the top of my head...

* The Caretaker - I don't know what it is about it, but it was a well made pilot episode. Even 25 years later, it remains one of the single most expensive episodes of TV ever produced and felt almost like a nice little science fiction B film.
* Future's End I &amp; II - They end up in 1996 California chasing after a ship from the far future. It's a lot of fun to watch because it can't be taken too seriously. I'm no fan of Sarah Silverman but her presence in these two episodes makes them pretty fun.
* Blink of an Eye - This is the one where Voyager ends up orbiting a planet where time is experienced faster on the surface than it would be in space. The residents on the surface spot a light in the sky and spend the next few hundred years evolving, constantly trying to determine what this object is in the sky.
* Real Life - I don't care for episodes about family, but this one was good. It managed to be really funny but then really sad and offered great development for The Doctor.

There are probably others, but these are definitely the ones that immediately come to me. Unpopular opinion as well: Year of Hell sucked. It was interesting...but then at the end - in typical Voyager fashion - everything resets and they go on their way like nothing happened.",startrek,b190301,False,/r/startrek/comments/ivuxr0/what_is_your_favourite_episodes_of_star_trek/,0

2755,Trying to get in to Star Trek (TV shows) - Which series should a big fan of BSG &amp; Stargate start with?,1600460095,"COVID's a thing and I'm trying out new series to binge. I never really got into Star Trek growing up. My dad was a HUGE fan, but the real-world themes didn't resonate with kid-me. TNG was always on the TV but it was always background noise to me, never really *followed* it, if you know what I mean. I got into Enterprise for a time, and am definitely planning on binging that again sometime soon.

I DID however get into Stargate (all 3 series) and I absolutely love Battlestar Galactica (the reboot), my favorite Sci-Fi show of all time. 

Which Star Trek series would I like the most? Which should I start with? Excluding TOS, tbh. I just can't get into it, it's too dated for me. I'm thinking Voyager, a middleground between being not-too-dated and not-too-cheesy. My dad was never really into DS9, so I've always assumed I wouldn't like it (unreasonably). I should also note that I'm in (what I understand to be) the large minority in that I love Nemesis, it just stuck with me as a kid and now it's pure nostalgia for me.

Discovery I've found easily digestible and pretty to look at. Most I've watched was an 8 episode binge while to and from flights to Europe, thanks to CBS being available on the plane.

2759,Star Trek games you can get right now,1600458117,"Hi everyone, my last post about wanting to see more star trek games got a lot of comments (if not a lot of Karma) and so I thought you might be interested in what Star Trek games are around right now.  


First off, the original Starfleet Command is a great game that still holds up, even if it's graphics look like they're rendered in cardboard. You can install it, go to skirmish, and make yourself a 9 on 9 fleet battle between any of the TOS factions they included. I just went three rounds in a half hour and it's honestly probably, pound for pound, the best currently downloadable Star Trek game available. Go watch the Battle of the Binary Stars and set yourself up a round, it's real fun I promise!  


[ Next up, Star Trek Bridge Crew. Looks really cool and fun, but I lack a VR headset and playing without one was, for me at least, basically impossible. I imagine it's better with friends and with the appropriate equipment, but unless you've already got those it's kind of hard to justify buying it.  


[ Star Trek Online has been around for a while, and you likely already know it. It's an MMO on the decline and I haven't personally played the expansions, but there is plenty of trek themed content around a serviceable MMO that once upon a time admirably carried the burden of being our only way to play past the end of Voyager in the prime timeline. And hey, some of the stories are cool! (It's great for people who love buying lootboxes!)  


[ Star Trek Starfleet Acadamy is a flight sim that has footage of the original trek actors, and is well reviewed, though I couldn't tell you how it is personally. Might pick it up on sale, but if I'm being honest, probably not.

[ I don't really count Star Trek Timelines, because it's basically a fancy UI over a random number generator phone game, but it exists, technically, so here.  
[ Also, for the sake of completeness, there are some adventure games (that seem neat but I'm not buying for $10 a pop)

[ [ And, unless you wanna go trolling around for an old physical copy of Elite Force or The Fallen somewhere, that's it!

2766,Why Is This So Hard? We Just Want Simple Trek...,1600452213,"I've been talking with friends lately and Star Trek came up. At least in our group, we're fascinated by what we feel is a disconnect between the powers that control it and many fans.

Obviously we don't speak for everyone, but my friends group is really diverse across a large age range, gender, backgrounds, etc. All of us agreed on a few points:

Get us a show like Next Generation, but just keep going. Forget this shoe-horning of trying to go over the same periods we've already seen, or prequels. Pike? Eh. Maybe it'll be good, but not one of us is excited about it. 

Second, think SNL and by that I mean continuation. Take the show and make it a revolving cast. Every year cycle in a new character to the ship/show and let an older one move on. The big ones stay 4-7 years or so, but ultimately let them move up and on with cameos moving forward. We'd all watch. Sure, some cycles might not be as good, but many will be better than ever. 

Third, STICK TO FREAKING CANON. None of us like what JJ Abrams did. We love these characters and this universe for what it is. Period. Spock running around emotional, in love, jealous is NOT SPOCK. The new Pike series scares the crap about of us as in interviews the new guy playing the young Spock is like, ""because he's younger we'll be able to explore more about his being less polished"". No! How do you not understand Vulcans yet??? Every so often having a challenge? Sure, but a reckless Spock isn't Spock. You might as well just create a new character. 

More than anything else get rid of these people that don't understand Roddenberry's core points about why Star Trek worked in the first place. How these people like Berman and such end up in control of the property is just mind blowing. Even when they think they have new ideas they can't even follow through. Take Voyager. It had all the ingredients and two of the best characters in the Trek world (in Seven and the Doctor), but the writers couldn't ever let go of Earth. The whole point of the show was that they were entirely lost in a new quadrant of space and yet every season we had to get shows about Earth or shows that pulled in favorite races of the Alpha quadrant. 

Just set the show a few years after TNG and get the crew out there exploring. When things get a bit lost, it's time for some new crew. We'll watch. Seriously.",startrek,pcserenity,False,/r/startrek/comments/ivb66v/why_is_this_so_hard_we_just_want_simple_trek/,0

2772,Star Trek Picard - and why i am not a fan of it,1600445852,"This is an opinion piece about PIC and contains some spoilers about VOY, you have been warned. It also might be considered a rant.

&amp;#x200B;

Plot holes and similar problems that plague almost all modern shows these days no withstanding (not to mention that Star Treks record in that regard was never stellar to begin with), i am right now watching VOY:Endgame and realized that something i did read about Seven of Nine and her relationship to Janeway that one of the producers said is total Bogus:

(If someone finds the link to it, please notify me, as i was unable to!)

They basically said that they did not think that the relationship between Seven of Nine and Janeway was all that important or all that close in Voyager.

Yet here i am watching Endgame, were Future and Current Janeway have a little exchange about saving others or saving the crew, and the first thing that Future Janeway does to shut up Present Janeway is tell her about Seven of Nines death, which does give her pause immediately,

Also, Future Janeways reaction when Seven enters the sickbay is not one i would expect from someone that would not care about her.

I think that Seven of Nines role and her quest of becoming human is very much a similar theme to that of Datas quest, yet other than Data Seven of Nine often enough went more directly against Janeways wishes and the dynamic between the two is a definite plus to the entire show.

In the end i think their relationship is one of the most important elements of the show, especially as Seven is standing outside the rank order and is showing a very different approach to handling things, as her view on the universe is very different than that of rest of the crew.

Yet in the end, both Janeway and Seven share a deep bond of mutual respect and friendship. Especially Janeway does go through a very important development that in the end also grounds her a bit against the possibility that her role as captain gets to her head to much (captains of ships in ancient past and the future come directly after god and i think that without Seven Janeway might have started to belive this herself. Especially Endgame and the Future, cynical Janeway brings it to the point when she states that the crew is blinded by devotion).

And in the end i find the way that some of the characters were treated in PIC simply not to my liking. And while on the one side am glad that we did not get a carbon copy of TNG with the new show, i think that in general Star Trek needs to have more Star Trek in it and be a bit more bold in exploring new themes, yet stay more in line with the original vision. DSC did that when they refused to blow up the enemy at the end, where they stated they are Starfleet and this is not how they operate.

PIC basically in my opinion was some generic, dystopian Sci-Fi and other than having some of my favorite actors in it, not very original or noteworthy and a far cry from past Star Trek glory.

Heck, i like DSC more and that says something. PIC is also the first Star Trek show which i could not stomach to rewatch after the first completion (i did rewatch single episodes during the release though, as i always do and oh btw.: stop the bullshit weakly releases ffs).

In theory, he can live through that many years and be able to remain a great doctor of the Federation. In otherwise this is after more than 700 years, so this is likely the 31-32th century where the Federation presumably are collapsed.

* Slytherin:  Kirk more often succeeds through guile than force.  As well, the intensity of his ambition is legendary--youngest in Starfleet to ever gain the captain's chair, and that of the jewel of the fleet.  After being reluctantly promoted, he relentlessly reacquired command of the Enterprise when V'Ger threated.  He'll break simulation code, starfleet regs, General Orders, and bend the Prime Directive to his will if he decides something's important enough.
* Ravenclaw:  Kirk is an intellectual--the ""stack of books with legs"" in his Academy days, as Gary Mitchell related.  His favorite pastime is reading, and he is self-directed student of history and lover of antiques.  His victory over the Gorn in ""Arena"" was a pure Ravenclaw solution.

2817,Watching Stargate SG1 as a lifelong Trek fan is so frustrating,1600351195,"Growing up, TNG was on the television. While I watched enough to know I liked it, I didn't really follow things all that closely, particularly since I was basically still a kid. As an adult I decided I'd start at the beginning with TOS and I watched everything that was available that Trek had to offer (minus the Animated Series for some reason). 

I went from TOS to Continues (non canon but awesome). From Continues to TNG. TNG to DS9 (still my favorite). DS9 to VOY. VOY to ENT and ENT to DIS (which was just about to start its 2nd season I think). I love everything about what Trek represents and, with a few exceptions, enjoyed watching it all. 

I've since done a rewatch of DS9 and I'm mid way through Season 5 of my rewatch of VOY. 

A friend recommended Stargate to me. A little background made me think it would scratch similar itches as Trek would - Aliens, space travel, exploration...sure why not!

Then I started watching. As Trek fans we all know the Prime Directive is king. Don't interfere with the natives (particularly pre-warp species), don't violate their laws, don't push your beliefs onto the natives...ALL THINGS SG-1 DOES EVERY DAMN MISSION.

SG-1 visits a planet where women are subservient to men and what do they do? Carter bucks tradition, causes a revolt and fundamentally alters the culture of the species. 

SG-1 visits a planet where they live for 120 days and worship a statue as if it were their God. What does SG-1 do? Your beliefs are wrong and topple the statue causing them an undoubted existential crisis. 

SG-1 has no First Contact protocols, no appreciation for not interfering with natives and no sense of responsibility for the implications of the things they do while interacting with native species (admittedly the other species are almost all human but may as well be alien all things considered). There's been some serious questionable decisions made too like leaving sentient robot versions of themselves on a planet for example.

I'm not saying what SG-1 attempts to do is wrong or ill intended...they just don't stick around long enough to know how the changes they are implementing will play out. Furthermore they don't seem to think about the long term implications at all!

So far I like Stargate. Its a decent piece of Sci-Fi and after having watched the first season I'm sure I'll continue. That being said, as a Trek fan - it is super frustrating to watch just how little they seem to regard the customs, cultures and people they find whenever they jump through the gate to a new planet...or how what they do while on that planet will affect those customs, cultures and people long term.",startrek,RyoOfWildFire,False,/r/startrek/comments/iuk0ci/watching_stargate_sg1_as_a_lifelong_trek_fan_is/,0

This is Kurtzman’s show and will be terrible just like his last one or this is just CBS new cheap cash grab labelled as Star Trek. 

But they are just WRONG, „the proof of the pudding is in the eating” and „don't judge a book by its cover” what they need to understand.

**Episode 7 - ""Much Ado About Boimler""**

* Dogs have been kept as pets by several characters including Janeway, Picard, and most famously Jonathan Archer. Archer's beagle Porthos was implied, in one timeline at least, to have suffered a fate similar to The Dog's fellow freak Boimler by falling victim to a transporter accident.
* Another loose connection to ENT can be seen when The Dog turns into a spider-demon and scampers up the wall; in ""Doctor's Orders"" Phlox mentions having seen *The Exorcist* during an NX-01 movie night.
* The story involving Freeman and other senior officers being temporarily reassigned for a covert mission echoes ""Chain of Command"":
   * the ninja outfits they wear are the same worn by Picard and his team
   * their mission involves rulot seeds, established in ""The Homecoming"" as a Cardassian plant; Picard's team investigated Cardassian operations
   * the officers in both episodes were picked specifically for their unique expertise regarding the mission objectives
   * Freeman is replaced by another captain, just as Picard was replaced
   * Picard's replacement, Edward Jellico, is name-dropped by Mariner
* Boimler is ""phased"" in the transporter, something that happened to Geordi and Ro in ""The Next Phase,"" although in that episode the phasing involved the victims being able to pass through objects (except, you know, the floor, and the oxygen they needed to breathe).
* Rutherford calculates Boimler's phasing as ""one millicochrane."" The cochrane is a common technobabble unit of measurement ostensibly used to describe distortions in subspace fields.
* The sub crew's Lt. Pratchett (name source undetermined) is a Rigelian, long-mentioned but first seen in ""Affliction."" Pratchett is played by legendary voice actor Maurice LaMarche, making his canon Trek debut here.
* We've previously explored the trinkets in Freeman's ready room, but unnoticed until this week is what looks to be a statue (or action figure) of a Gorn as introduced in ""Arena.""
* The design of the *Osler* is very likely taken from that of the battleships of Warhammer 40k.
* The *Osler* might be named after William Osler, one of the founding physicians of Johns Hopkins. I absolutely made this connection myself and definitely did not just look up the disambiguation on wikipedia.
* The D14 operative is a member of the same species as Arex, the *Enterprise* navigator during TAS. Although not explicitly linked to Arex in canon, the name of his race is accepted by most official sources as Edosian.
* The Edosian wears an outlandish piece of futuristic technology usually called a ""face mask.""
* Ramsey claims her team fought off four Borg using ""Vulcan jiu-jitsu."" A Vulcan martial art known as suus mahna was featured in ENT and DIS.
* Mariner mentions a professor named Saul Rubichik; this is suspiciously close to Saul Rubinek, whose early career included the role of Kivas Fajo in ""The Most Toys.""
* The freaks include
   * The leader, who suffers from both rapid and reverse aging. Rapid aging was explored in ""The Deadly Years"" and ""Unnatural Selection"" while de-aging was featured in ""The Counter-Clock Incident"" and ""Rascals.""
   * Ensign Jenna was exposed to delta radiation, and appears to have been given the standard treatment: confinement to a boop chair, just as Christopher Pike was in ""The Menagerie.""
   * Ellis and Sanderson were merged in a transporter accident, though not quite as seamlessly as Neelix and Tuvok were in ""Tuvix."" At least they get to live.
   * ""Anthony,"" who has apparently turned into the same salamander creature that Sisko evolved into during ""The Visitor.""
* Magnetic boots were previously seen in *The Undiscovered Country,* *First Contact* and the occasional ENT episode.
* There have been a number of designs of Type 3 phaser rifles, but the one the Edosian grabs seems to most closely resemble the one seen in *First Contact.*
* The *Rubidoux* implodes to reveal a giant glowing space jellyfish, no doubt of the same species as those seen in ""Encounter at Farpoint.""",startrek,Antithesys,False,/r/startrek/comments/iuihwd/canon_references_much_ado_about_boimler_spoilers/,0
2821,Diversity on the ship,1600345128,"Is it just me, or does the animated Enterprise seem to have the most diversity of all the primary ships we've seen as far as Starfleet personnel goes? The Enterprise and Enterprise A had tons of humans and Spock, who was half human in the first place. What little we saw of the Enterprises B and C were all human (unless I'm forgetting something). 

The Enterprise D had a klingon officer and an android officer. After a while, a bajoran officer shows up intermittently. Oh, and we can't forget the Bolian barber. DS9, despite being a station that ended up being a transit hub was all humans with a few bajorans on loan (since Bajor wasn't officially a part of the Federation yet) and eventually got the Enterprise D's klingon. Even the brief time Nog was in the academy ended up with him being out because of his leg.

Voyager took off as all human, eventually revealed they had a vulcan, and adopted a few bajorans  and yet more humans. 

Enterprise NX01, being all humans and a beagle with a vulcan and denobulan on loan at least makes sense, because it was the beginning.

And Discovery... no offense to the tremendous acting of Doug Jones, but honestly, after watching Enterprise, I was irked to, yet again, see the past of Star Trek showing us species that didn't come up in later series'. Granted, that got explained away, but couldn't they have given us some members of the Federation that have been in there for a while that HAVEN'T HAD MUCH SCREEN TIME AT ALL?

The animated series not only still had Spock, but that cat girl, an andorian, and at least one or two others whose species I never learned. And even if they didn't get much screen time or all that many lines compared to the Big Three, at least it showed the Enterprise being a Federation ship, and not a human ship that's a member of the Federation.",startrek,Dudeness77,False,/r/startrek/comments/iuiazp/diversity_on_the_ship/,0

2824,Why is Star Trek: Enterprise hated so much?,1600330397,"As a pre-note, I have seen TOS, TNG, Voyager, and just finished Enterprise. None of the ""old"" movies have been seen and only 2 of the new ones.

As I watched each Star Trek series, I actually must say that I felt each Captain had their own personalities and a unique handling of their crew (as they should) but i started with the opinion of the usual TOS over TNG but Picard over Kirk. 

As I explored Janeway (for some reason) I shifted to Picard AND TNG over Kirk and TOS (no hate on Kirk, he's great). But as a woman Captain and her lovely overall spirit, she felt so right to be in that captains chair! I loved her every decision and how she never measured as weak. On several occasions she gave orders and those below her could not or would not comply (usually an ethical wall) and she had the balls to do it herself.. essentially saying to those under her ""i wouldn't ask you to do something i wouldn't be willing to do myself"". I actually have to say so far she is actually my favorite captain. 

So, Captain Jonathan Archer. His personality is that of a man who is ready to take off the training wheels from earth. A new Era for mankind, with a Captain true at heart at the command, ready to make great leaps with his hand held outward to all. He really has a knack for bringing out the strength in others. 

Archer might not stand out like the others but from the view of time earth just really getting out of their solar neighborhood.. you couldn't really expect a hardcore Captain like the others..

I'm happy that O'Brien didnt have to suffer anymore. His story was complete. He had a great family and now he could go enjoy life with them on earth and not be tortured anymore or constantly be told to do 10 hours worth of work in 2. But I wish they would have made him a Master Chief Petty Officer though in his farewell scene. His badassery would have been complete. 

The final showdown with Dukat I think was great. Operatic in its climax. Dukat got the sendoff he deserved as so did the Kai (with a residue of redemption at the last possible second). But Sisko dying but not really dying. It just made me feel like he was forever away from his family and friends. Like some lonely ghost. I'd rather he would be given the chance to do that monologue he had to Jake rather than Cassidy. 

Glad Garak got to go home. He probably schemed up something on the shuttle trip to cardassia that had nothing to do with hemming. 

Quark still where he started on day one. What's a Ferengi got to do to get a small little moon or something? 

Worf becoming a diplomat? I didnt buy that. I felt like they BS'ed that in 5 seconds. I'd have rather he decided to help Alexander or build a batleth studio next to his parents house or something. 

Poor Kira. That last shot of her and Jake alone. It felt so lonely. He didnt get to say goodbye to his father and her sort of boyfriend went back to the genocidal founders instead of growing and becoming truly comfortable with the solids (that's the way I see it). Now she's in charge of the station with most of her friends gone and no obvious romantic partner in sight.

Julian too. I had a hard time believing he would somehow make things click with the less than confident Ezri after letting Jadzia slip through his fingers. It just felt like he lost his best friend and was now kind of alone on the station. 

But dont get me wrong. These aren't really BAD endings. Most are perfectly realistic given the show's context. And it would be silly to assume they'd all pal around for life never getting promoted or transfered like Harry Kim. But the endings just feel quite sad for the most part. That's why I have a love-hate relationship with it. It's like watching your college clique break up on the last day of school. Not bad.

DS9: I thought Sisko was OK but I was never really blown away by him except for ""In The Pale Moonlight"" which might be my favorite episode of all Trek.

I watched DS9 as a kid and it wasn't until a friend in college was watching it for the first time that the parallels to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict were brought to my attention. His mention of it was vague enough that I didn't know what exactly he was referring to, and it came to mind that there are actually at least two different parallels.  


First, the Cardassian occupation of Bajor is a rather broad allegory for many different oppressive occupations that have occurred in human history. The British occupation of India, many other instances of European colonialism and of course arguably also the situation faced by the Palestinians.  


But there's another arguable parallel that is perhaps less obvious unless you are familiar with certain criticisms of Israel: The changelings.

The changelings are a people who have been oppressed and persecuted in nearly every instance where they've tried to live among solids. They eventually came to the misguided conclusion that the only way to secure safety for their own race was to control everyone else. They rarely exert their control directly, but instead via intermediaries (the Jem Hadar and Vorta). They have a sense that it is right that they rule over all of the other races. I want to make it clear I don't believe in any of the parallel assertions about Jewish people or even necessarily Israeli, but I can't help but see the parallels to common anti-Israel (and indeed anti-semitic) talking points.  


Backing off from the specific parallels, I think that the Bajorans and Changelings represent two sides of the experience of an oppressed people.  


I think the parallels people draw with Bajorans in term of tradition and religion may be a bit of a stretch, and I think the fact that they were *only* oppressed by the Cardassians (as far as we know) makes their link with Jewish people--who have been oppressed and persecuted repeatedly by many different cultures--a bit imperfect. But the Bajorans represent a people who escape oppression and ultimately avoid falling to the same tendencies.  


I think the Changelings represent the danger. They show what can happen when an oppressed people fail to learn the right lesson from their oppression, resulting in a continuation of the cycle. They were persecuted for being different, and in turn they persecute those different from them. They were distrusted by all, and in turn they refuse to trust anyone.  


So no I don't think that the Changelings were intended to represent Jews or the Israeli state as they actually exist today. But I think that they possibly represent what *could* happen if things get out of hand. And, by that same token, that allegory can be applied to many other people as well.

2891,Why does no one ever mention the awesome destructive power of Warp speed technology?,1600224644,"If you took an object with a mass of 1,500 metric tons, for example a fully fueled NASA space shuttle, accelerated it to 30% the speed of light and aimed it at an M-class planet, the force of the explosion it would create when hitting said planet would be equivalent to 1.5 million megatons of TNT.

How much is 1.5 million megatons? Imagine every single nuclear weapon that is currently on Earth exploding at the same time - then multiply that by 150.

This one space shuttle, at just 30% *c* would be enough to completely annihilate Earth's ecosystem in a single blow. 

Let's say we up the speed a little. At ""only"" 86.6% light-speed the amount of kinetic energy is equal to the rest mass, which means that our hypothetical space shuttle would inflict upon the target the same energy as if it was composed of pure antimatter. 1,500 metric tons of antimatter.

Now imagine it was traveling *literally a thousand times faster.*

What I'm getting at here, is that any Warp-capable vessel in the Star Trek universe could be very easily turned into a weapon of mass destruction capable of wiping out an entire solar system. Don't know how to stop the Borg cube? Shoot a shuttle at it at Warp 6 and watch the entire cube get liquefied at the molecular level. Trouble with the Dominion? Turn their homeworld into a new asteroid belt with a single attack. After all, a Galaxy Class ship weighs 5 million tons, so at just 86.6% *c* that would be like 5 million tons of pure antimatter.

I know, of course, that including this as an actual plot point would more or less torpedo the entire premise of Star Trek. I just wish they would at least acknowledge it in some way.

So now just as Seven tried to make sense of all that information with unsubstantiated claims, so do those who lack the skills needed to process the barrage of information we are exposed to in our daily lives.

2917,"Of all Star Trek technologies, The Universal Translator has the least basis in reality and science.",1600198591,"The universal translator combined with a few sentences never before heard, and voila, you've deciphered a new language with no common roots other than (sometimes) 4 billion year old DNA.

And if DNA played a major role, it isn't shown in ST or IRL. I mean we can't decipher languages made by the same species (humans), just thousands of years ago but we could decipher those of people we've never heard of. And coming into life on different planets would make it almost impossible to find a common feature to base on (for classical translation).

So how can the Universal Translator decipher new languages? As far as I can tell there are 2 possible methods listed below-

&amp;#x200B;

**The (Im)Possible methods of \[Initial\] Translation-**

&amp;#x200B;

* Option 1, Classical: 

That is translation by deduction &amp; logic. Now the most you can get during first contact is a few sentences. And maybe you can translate them if the first few words are almost always the same across species. But the most you can get from the sentences is child-level grammar structure. And that too is a miracle in most cases. Even if the UT somehow translated the the first few sentence, there is no way it can know the meaning of new words without no prior knowledge. So the only way it can translate more (unheard) words is by listening to broadcasts (and hoping they've similar communiques to us) as it's practically impossible to predict how a culture will develop/developed in 10 years, let alone 1,000 years (to sufficiently translate the entire language) from a few words, and how the people look. But in the case of ENT, the language was translated within minutes of first view, which is virtually impossible. The more likely thing to happen would be what the Kreetarians did- taking our language's database and running some algorithm to translate it.

&amp;#x200B;

* Option 2, Mind-Reading :

 Makes a little more sense as mind-reading is possible via artificial constructs (PIC). Note that I said mind-reading as Mind-melds only allow you to see memories &amp; their associated memories (as far as it is shown) whereas true telepathy could allow you to see their thoughts.

 Now, How do we remember the meaning of basic words? We won't remember paraphrased definitions as they would require us to remember more words. More likely than not, we would've connected them to memories. Which means UTs have to understand a memory. For now, let's say they understood them somehow. But this still won't make sense. Ferengis, due to their unusual brain structure, can't be read by telepaths (at least Betazoids), but somehow 24th century UT could translate their language (In ENT, the Ferengi translated English using their UTs, not Starfleet's, so there would be little record). And with Tamarians (Children of Tama), the UT supposedly can't translate anymore than the base words. But if the UT is telepathic it would/will have understood the meaning behind phrases (as the UT translating you saying 'Go break a leg' literally into, for example, Klingon will end up with your broken legs). And of course, ignoring privacy too could create major problems.

Some have said it interprets brain waves. But almost no species can share similar/same neuro-receptors, neuro-chemicals. And some species even have completely different brain structures. And some, completely different biology. So finding commonality b/w their brain patterns would be a herculean task.

&amp;#x200B;

Which means neither option works (and as far as I could find, there were no other methods)

&amp;#x200B;

**The Aesthetic mistakes (Maybe excusable as the show would've become irritating)**

* The almost infinite processing speed required for translating the words as soon as they're said. There are some experimental live chat translators IRL, but i) they've the usual lag of &amp; wait until their is pause while talking. So it would make sense if there was some lag.
* And even if the above could be done, there exists the fact that every next word said (&amp; how it's said) changes the meaning of the whole sentence in some languages (including English), requiring the UT to predict/ know the future.
* The native language being cancelled out. This could make sense if everyone used ferengi based UTs, but many won't agree to sub-dermal implants. Also many species won't take kindly to their voices being overwritten. 

The only 'episode' that actually obeys these rules was 'the brightest star', where Lt. Georgiuo words are translated slower &amp; aren't cancelled out by the Kelpian's language when speaking to Saru. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I get that it is supposed a plot device, but so is a warp drive, phaser or a transporter. Granted they need some assumptions (Subspace, Nadions, Perfect M-E conversion), but at least they're built on top of that. Add to that they have reasonable real world replicas / theories (See this) But as far as I can see, there is no reasonable assumption for the UT to work as it does in ST, nor is there one in real life.",startrek,DarthMaw23,False,/r/startrek/comments/itfx9e/of_all_star_trek_technologies_the_universal/,0
2918,"Most Star Trek Technologies are no longer a possible solution to a problem, but are results of developments.",1600198585,"These include theories as well, for some technologies are scientifically sound but don't have the required resources.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Transporters-** A transporter with ME-conversion can exist but would be way bulkier than shown (and would also require a receiver). But a much simpler transporter could be a ''duplicator &amp; disintegrator'' (a duplicate item is sent down, and the original is destroyed), but this can only 'transport' things that are near stationary at the atomic level (Hello, Uncertainty Principle), and therefore no living things (But ST managed somehow violate it using 'Heisenberg Compensator, so...'). Or maybe we would've found a method to control &amp; induce quantum tunneling.
* **Warp Drive-** Something similar to Alcubierre Drive as well as spacetime bubbles (way too complicated to explain here, check this [link]( * **Replicators-** A replicator can be similar to a transport or may use a deposit of a single element/ compound  which can be changed into any thing using nuclear transmutation (or fusion) and simple 3-d printing.
* **Phasers-** Handheld Phasers and Ship Phasers are similar enough to LASERs (Stun could either be a particle weapon or some variation of wireless electricity). Or maybe you went crazy and decided to use focused Plasma, which could still do all that Phasers can (And maybe stun could be sensor overload caused by plasma discharge or a voltage differential or wireless electricity).
* **Photon Torpedos-** Photon Torpedoes are just M-AM reaction missiles.
* **Impulse drive** An Impulse drive is a combination of Fusion propulsion (By heating plasma, like how water is heated through fission, and then releasing it for thrust) and subspace sublight propulsion (A similar thing can be done to spacetime using the Alcubierre drive). Possible without warp engines.
* **Cloaking Device-** A cloaking device IRL could be either cameras and projectors or a radiation absorber (which can only be found by searching for stars missing).
* **Artificial Gravity-** Artificial gravity is probably generated using (theoretical) artificial gravitons. Or by us via rotation. 
* **Tractor Beams-** Tractor beams can use gravitational fields (via gravitons) or EM fields (if the target ship is Paramagnetic).
* **Comms/Tricorders-** You've got something in your pocket millions of times faster &amp; versatile than Communicators &amp; Tricorders. And a variation of that, and you've all the sensors needed.
* **Force Fields-** We can use plasma controlled through EM fields to make 'force fields', but these will be relatively weak and would be more helpful as a emergency bulkhead. And your hand may be burnt depending on how concentrated the plasma is. You could be temporarily blinded,too...
* **Shields (Deflectors)-** Deflectors arrays/ Shields use Force fields, but until we can make the Plasma Variant stronger or discover new particles (such as Nadions in ST), they wouldn't be useful. But again stronger EM fields via superconducting magnets may be enough to stop ST weapons. Such a field may be enough to break Antimatter containment in photon torpedoes (as containment is magnetic in nature / is a penning trap), effectively self-destructing the missile. It could also divert Plasma from IRL phasers (no idea about Nadions' magnetism, though) around the field (thus the ship too). LASERs will be way more complicated, as they can be affected by EM fields (but not by much), but Plasma Force field could dissipate it. No idea about Transporter blocking due to unconfirmed methods of Transportation transmission.
* **Holodecks-** We have the display / image part figured out (at least microscopically) but for tactile purposes a haptic (tactile) glove is more likely than ''re-sequenced'' photons. Or maybe we manage to accurately control atoms using EM fields, and can create a sort of skin for the hologram.
* **Bio-Neural Circuitry-** See [Synthetic Biological Circuitry]( * **Dermal Regenerators-**  This can be done by either grafting cloned skin / artificial replacements (which could be dissolvable stitches), or by speeding up their natural regeneration via chemicals that play a part in healing.
* **Hypospray-** A jet injector (from which the term 'hypospray' originated) is technically a needle-less injection but we've yet to come across truly painless &amp; no risk hypospray (though many are in development).
* **Universal Translators-**  This is the only thing I can't sufficiently define IRL, other than for already translated langues. Will be explained more in this post.",startrek,DarthMaw23,False,/r/startrek/comments/itfx6h/most_star_trek_technologies_are_no_longer_a/,0

2935,Why I've come to love Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,1600173773,"For a long time I shared in the mutual dislike for STV. It's cheesy in parts, cannon breaking scenes for the sake of a cheap laugh (rocket boosting up the lift shaft past deck 78), a backwards step in special effects, etc.  


But I re-framed the film in my mind and learned to fall in love with it. Here are just a few of my reasons:  


* I view it as a buddy film, the settings and drama are secondary. We know the history of the main characters and we're at a point where we're watching long matured friendships (even if there's a military-esk hierarchical nature to why they're together in the first place). So much is about the nature of their friendships, it gives us insight into where they are in later middle age, where what they're left with are a few core friends, which is what most people are left with from their earlier years.   
The film ends where it starts. With a core set of good friends who have just been through another profound life changing event. They settle down, knowing all the baggage each person's build up over their lives, and feeling the safety of solid ground with people that understand each other the most.
* Kirk's journey into introspection about himself and his own relationship with himself. There was some quirky nonsense about him falling off a cliff, but the deeper part of that was Kirk exploring his relationship with himself, looking to rekindle the feeling of risk and meaning to his life, and realising he's not that young invincible captain any more. He's wondering about his own nature and of those around him. His comments at the end of the film about knowing he'll die alone are a sort of a conclusion to that part of his personal journey in the film. It also adds to the often equally disliked death of Kirk. He did die alone, completely removed from his loved ones and friends who have long since gone (except maybe Scotty who's probably still limping around in a shuttle somewhere getting up to all sorts). He died on an unfamiliar planet, with just one unfamiliar person nearby and no one else even knew he was alive at that point.
* It's shows us the winter years of a crew's career. They get into another scrape but age has started to overcome experience. The ship's not ready, the crew's not ready but the universe will not stop coming at them. They're getting too old for this, and they're realising that. They handed over the reigns to the next generation in the next film quite dramatically, but they were pulled out of retirement for that. What we're seeing here is the years before retirement. It may be about the time the older senior officers realise it's not their game any more. 
* I enjoy their exploration of faith, and how that can be manipulated to make good people do terrible things. Sybok wasn't a bad man, he was just misguided. Possibly manipulated from afar by the creature imprisoned on the planet who reached out and found a weak mind. Sybok in turn used common ground in other faiths and brain washing techniques to bring people into a cult. A very bad path from someone who's intention seemed to be genuine and believed by him to be good.

Many will likely disagree with my thoughts which is fair and many will still dislike STV still even if they agree with them. But for me personally, I've found a love for it now and I wouldn't want to replace that.",startrek,WarezWolf359,False,/r/startrek/comments/it7zud/why_ive_come_to_love_star_trek_v_the_final/,0

Because they are in command of that department. Basically everyone in the senior briefings should wear red.

It also doesn't make sense to have a red uniform to show you're in the command branch, because what are you commanding? 4 pips would make sense, you're a captain. But let's say you're in command of engineering, then 2 colors should be used; red and yellow. The pips are hard to see. People that are new on a ship must then shout ""who's in command of engineering?!"". To know who's the boss over there.

It's almost as if the red uniform is distributed randomly. E.g the helmsman wears red. But why? It's an operations task, just like firing phasers and polish the warp core.

The red uniform would only make sense if only the first officer, captain and the head of the branches on the ship wear red, with an extra color around the collar of their neck to signify which branch they are in command of. Of which the captain and first officer just have a black collar.

Admiral Janeway stole a special shuttle and a prototype device to go back in time and make the Voyager journey significantly shorter. Other Starfleet officers try to stop her referring to the Temporal Prime Directive, a law/rule so people cant just change the timeline as they want. 

Janeway dont just give them a faster way to home, but very advanced and dangerous future anti-borg technology. Just from a few hours of modifications Voyager become so much powerful that can go against three borg cube, play a tug of war with them and blow up two of them with easy.

The stranded Voyager crew without help or much of a resources was capable to integrate the ablabtive armors, what can withstand a multiple borg cube attacks with low difficulty. Their future transphasic torpedoes can destroy an entire borg cube with one hit.  And these significant advancements are still on Voyager when they arrive home.

Just imagine what would happen when the Klingon Empire or the Romulan StarEmpire learns about these horribly powerful and destrictive weapons the Federation have. It can caus distrust and outrage between the races and would become problematic and start political affairs with them. Or they can put their hands on it and mass produce and weaponize the future technology or anything else. You remember how much the Borg wanted One the Drone with 29th century tech, they made a great effort to recuit him to the collective and study him.

First, I'll admit that I'm not up on all the stuff that goes on outside of the movies and TV shows, so it's entirely possible that this subject has been covered in an interview with a producer, or a comic book, or novel, or some other source.  Also, this may have been already talked about here and I didn't notice because I wasn't caught up with Discovery and didn't join the subreddit until after I had watched season 2 to protect myself from spoilers.  So I am sorry if this has topic has already been discussed and put to bed.

[Topic starts here]

Like it or not, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is canon (again, unless something happened outside of the TV shows that I haven't seen) and therefore, so is the existence of Sybok.

So why did Discovery never mention the existence of Spock's full-blooded Vulcan half-brother?

It's obvious from the flashbacks in Discovery that the focus was on the relationship between Michael and Spock and that they were close, at least up until she tries to run away, and while Spock mentions that he and Sybok were raised together after his mother's death he doesn't mention how old they were when this happens, but I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that these two time periods overlapped.

So, I have to ask; did the producers, writers, etc not do enough research? Did they choose to omit Sybok because of some kind of constraint, either time or money?

Made me realise that for every single episode where there’s some crazy stuff going down on the bridge, there’s probably like 500 other people on board going “They ordered us to do WHAT?!” but having to comply anyway. And at the end of all the drama, you don’t even get an explanation of wtf was going on because everything is classified. I think my head would explode. Lavelle was portrayed as being quite annoying for trying to press his friends for information they couldn’t divulge but I totally get where he was coming from.

(Also, Sito’s death broke my heart. Like, I kind of saw it coming, but they made her such a likeable character in only one episode and I would’ve loved to see her on the bridge sometime. I suppose it gave the episode some emotional poignance, but... they didn’t have to do my girl like that 😢)

Which reminds me, in general during battle scenes where the ship is being fired upon... are there like, really heavy sleepers who aren’t on duty or like civilians who just nap through the whole thing??

2987,Venus in Star Trek,1600099794,"There is nothing explicitly preventing the idea that humans in the Trek timeline are aware of life in the Venusian atmosphere. Indeed, there is nothing explicitly preventing the idea that humans aware of intelligent life anywhere else in the galaxy; First Contact was the first *interaction* with aliens, not necessarily the first *knowledge*. So if today's news pans out the way most of us hope it does, it should not create a ""continuity breach"" with the Trek universe.

Other than the occasional limerick, Venus is mentioned twice in a contemporary context. One reference was Chakotay, who said he did shuttle pilot training in Venus' atmosphere.

The more important reference was in ""Past Tense"" when the timeline changes and O'Brien tries to find Starfleet signatures, and mentions he can't find the ""terraforming stations on Venus.""

So in the Trek future, we are terraforming Venus. Would we do so if there were life there? Do the needs of humans outweigh the needs of microbes? Are they somehow terraforming ""around"" the life in a way that it survives the process? Is the Prime Directive involved in any form? Or is this a ""spoiler"" that the discovery announced today is not what we think it is, and Venus is indeed dead (or perhaps that there *is* life there, but by the 24th century it has gone extinct)?",startrek,Antithesys,False,/r/startrek/comments/isnwsg/venus_in_star_trek/,0

She has a general understanding of Trek, what Starfleet is, and the basic character traits of the players on the bridge.  She doesn't, however, have backstory on characters or know their interpersonal relationships yet.

I have been very successful in cherry-picking episodes, giving a one or two sentence back-story -- almost like you'd watch an episode of Black Mirror.  


I started with Inner Light.  All I had to tell her to be ready was that ""Picard isn't a family man.  He's kinda married to the job.""  


Then we watched Measure of a Man.  I had to tell her that Data and Yar had a relationship and that she'd since died.  


Next was Tapestry.  I had to tell her that Q is a God-like alien that comes and goes that likes to troll Picard and that Picard had an artificial heart.  


So, what's next?  


I like the episodes with moral dilemmas.  I was thinking ""Half a Life"" might be good.  Or maybe one of the good two-parters like Unification or Chain of Command, but I'm not sure if too much backstory on the various races is required.

Don't get me wrong, I like Beyond, but I understand why the general audience didn't warm up to it.

Beyond didn't outright flop, but it also didn't make the kind of money they hoped. The general audience was uninspired about the scenes from the trailer, motor cycle chases, explosions, martial arts fight scenes.  You can get all this in Marvel movies, so why go see the same stuff again?

I think the key to a successful Star Trek film, and I could be wrong, but I think the way to make a Star Trek film to really stand out from the pack is to make a story only Star Trek could tell. It has to be a novel concept that really doesn't work in other genres, or would be too out of left field. You can't make a Star Trek that is just heist in space, or revenge in space, or action movie in space.

It can have those elements of course, but it needs to be something truly unique and attention grabbing to make an audience go ""Huh, that looks wild, I gotta see that.""

3037,My thoughts on Voyager season 1 after watching TNG and DS9 (Spoilers for DS9 and VOY S1),1600022547,"I know this isn’t exactly a regular content post, but I wondered if people felt the same way that I did. About eleven years ago I watched Star Trek 2009 with my father, he was a big fan of the original series, watching it on a tiny television on a San Francisco naval base during his training before deployment to Vietnam. I loved Star Wars but never really bothered with Trek, but I thought the 2009 movie was pretty cool so one day at a friend’s house in 2010, I grabbed my friend’s Xbox 360 controller and watched season 1 of TNG on Netflix. I thought it was alright, but I didn’t have Netflix and have never been the type to binge watch movies or TV. Then, eight years later when I began exercising to lose weight I wanted something to watch, and our new cell phone plan included Netflix. So I went to season 2 of TNG and was hooked. I ended up watching all of TNG, then this summer all of Deep Space 9.  
  
Deep Space 9 was incredible, one of the best TV shows I’ve ever watched. I really enjoyed the moment to moment episodes of TNG but the continuity and the characters of DS9 were so good I couldn’t take my eyes off it. There were some off episodes, mainly early prophet episodes and Sisko Keiko fights, Klingon episodes and the Lwaxana love sickness and the creepy space pedo who sucked Jake’s brain juices, but I enjoyed nearly all of it. The dominion war was really exciting, and the Ferengis were hilarious changes of pace. However, I’m almost glad they ended it there. They reached that point where they pair off a long running show’s main characters into romances, so they had to create Vic Fontaine solely as a single character who would resolve plot threads pertaining to all the romances. Ezri wasn’t fantastic, and the pagh wraiths were pretty lame. If they continued I think the quality would have gone way down.  
  
So, after a failed attempt to watch TOS again, I figured I’d give Voyager a try and I feel..... very mixed emotions so far. I didn’t have these outright criticisms when I watched TNG or DS9. So I think I’ll just go through the characters and tell you how I feel about them.   
  
**Kathryn Janeway** — she says she has a hard time with the separation between captain and crew, but you could’ve fooled me. She refuses to crawl out of her shell at all, and treats this voyage as an Enterprise expedition instead of a harrowing journey home from the far reaches of the galaxy. I’d like to see a more personal side of her than some boring holonovel and a game of pool.  
  
**Chakotay** — brings a little too much of that “magical Indian” vibe. I get that he’s spiritual, but the amount of supernatural powers they grant him seems a little un-Treklike. He also drops right in as the role of the commander of a Starfleet ship, which makes sense given all his time in Starfleet, but I’d like to see more of his Maquis side and less of his Janeway lapdog side.   
  
**Tom Paris** — makes no sense. For a prison convict who doesn’t feel strongly for the Maquis or the federation, he sure has managed to become everyone’s friend. He has a lot to gain by getting home, his record wiped clean and a life anew, but I find it hard to believe that someone of his past could jump in and play Starfleet without missing a beat. If anything, he should be distrustful of everyone on board, and everyone should be wary of him. But nah, he may as well be just another bright eyed Starfleet officer.  
  
**Harry Kim** — exists  
  
**Bre’lonna Torres** I think she’s— ... okay fine. Harry Kim. I get that he’s supposed to be the ensign, in over his head and given significant responsibility. But he just.. doesn’t do anything wrong. You could throw Geordi in there seamlessly. Harry needs to be able to doubt himself and make mistakes for his character to be more believable. He’s also just so flat personality wise.   
  
**Bre’lonna Torres** — I think she’s one of the better characters. Her half Klingon thing she’s got going on could be interesting, especially in a quadrant where the series can’t be speckled with Klingon Empire dramas. Faces was a really really good episode, seeing both sides of her genetics was fascinating. But apart from the second episode and that, she’s been little more than the treknobabble engineer. I want more of her for season 2.   
  
**Kess** — yawn. She’s nothing but a mannequin for the doctor and Neelix to converse at. Not sold on her relationship with Neelix either. I’m sure the only reason she’s training as a nurse is to make neato episodes where something goes wrong with the doctor. Her telepathy stuff is Diet Troi. Pass.  
edit: I'm watching season 2 and she just ate a handful of bugs. That was genuinely hilarious. Maybe hope for her yet?  
  
**Emergency Medical Hologram** — interesting guy. I’m glad they gave him feelings and allow him to explore his rights and sentience. The Viking episode let him shine and that was a joy to watch. He notices who treats him as a hologram and who treats him as a person and acts accordingly and I enjoy that dynamic.   
  
**Neelix** — easily the best character on the show by far. The only character that really makes me happy when he’s on screen. The show needed a native and a guide for the Delta Quadrant, and he fits into that role perfectly. They need someone who can clash with the ship’s personnel, since they’re so bad at highlighting the Starfleet-Maquis split in any meaningful way. His love for cooking and desire to get along with everyone pushes Janeway and the others into being interesting, even if only for a little while. The episode with the evil doctor was by far the best of season 1. Neelix is full of life and emotion, basically the only character who fits that bill so far. I want to see a lot more of him, if they’re not going to resuscitate any of the bridge crew.  
  
**Tuvok** — oh yeah, I forgot about him. That last Neelix sentence reminded me he exists. What made Spock so cool was his relationship with Kirk, his banter with McCoy, and the things he’d do to protect his friends. Take all that away and you get Tuvok. He’s just Logic McLogicson. I will do this thing because it is logical, and only break the rules and following the rules is illogical. Its cool we’re seeing neck pinches and mind melds, but this guy is completely half baked.  
  
So there you have it I think. I haven’t felt this.. ambivalent about a Star Trek cast before. So many of them are just flat and dull, and the episodes feel more like TNG2 than a show about getting home from the unknown, and not in a good way. I’m really hoping the characters get better later, the plots are pretty interesting but the characters need a ton of work outside of Neelix. I’m curious how other TNG and DS9 fans feel about Voyager, but **please don’t talk about later seasons.** Thanks for reading!",startrek,lmhTimberwolves,False,/r/startrek/comments/is3ys4/my_thoughts_on_voyager_season_1_after_watching/,0
3038,So I’ve often thought what a Borg War might look like......,1600020953,"I’ve often thought that an idea of the Alpha Quadrant (not just the Federation) could end up having a long drawn out war with the Borg. Something has legs (multiple series) and sees the conflict from both sides and not be based on a single starship or cube (at least all of the time). If set in the timeline properly would allow the on screen introduction of a new Enterprise F/G. Would also allow for greater exploration of the Romulan/Federation relationship seen in Picard and would mean that all of the modern cinematic technology available could be brought to bear on epic scale on-screen battles between fleets in space.

3046,What it’s like watching Star Trek: The Motion Picture for the first time in 2020,1600012571,"I realise this is the second day in a row I’ve posted something praising the TOS era of Star Trek, but watching it for the first time it deserves to be spoken about (who doesn’t love discussing Trek) and because apparently not a lot of people like it.

After watching TOS for the first time recently I was blown away by how much I loved it, especially the way the show was able to create a universe as iconic as Star Trek with such a small budget. What made me most excited for MP was the thought of seeing this universe get the budget it deserved, however I was also nervous. I’d heard that the movie had received bad reviews from critics and fans with a 41% rating and was worried that this transition to the big screen might get rid of what made Star Trek what it is, it’s safe to say the critics were wrong. 

Straight away the movie blows you away with the Klingon attack against v’ger with some amazing special effects, especially the ship models. What surprised me the most was that this new iconic design was in the movie for around 2 minutes, however I’m guessing there will be more of them to come. Later on we are also treated to a beautiful sequence as Kirk and Scotty take a shuttle craft to board the Enterprise, as the filmmakers show off the amazing new model. However, the most impressive effect in the film has to be V’ger itself. An impressive mix of matte paintings and practical effects creates a mysterious alien that looks like nothing seen in the Star Trek universe up to now. Unlike TOS the motion picture is more accessible to a modern viewer like myself. The cheap 60s look is gone (for better or worse) and now the universe is more consistent to what modern sci-fi films look like. With a new Enterprise also comes new uniforms. I loved the 60s look of the original uniforms, with their bright colours that always stand out, but I can understand why they made the change. At first I despised the beige colour scheme that everything had, it wasn’t until the movie ended that I began to like the new designs and appreciate how the universe itself has advanced since we last saw it in TOS.

With this change in design as the film moves away from campy 60s cheapness, the tone of the story also changes. The most disturbing part of the movie has to be when the Enterprise transporter fails and we watch two crewman scream as their atoms merge together. This serious tone allows the actors to deliver great performances. Here Shatner plays a Kirk who is somewhat out of his league in this new Enterprise, instead of the campy starship captain who has been taken over by a woman. All the returning cast members do a great job in the roles, with the highlights once again being Kirk, Spock and Bones. However I was disappointed that Sulu, Uhura, Chekhov and Scotty had minimal roles apart from the occasional line and sitting in the bridge. The new characters introduced also add a depth that the show never had, with Deckers relationship to Ilia providing emotional moments the show rarely had. 

The story itself also felt very Star Trek, which isn’t surprising since it was originally the pilot for a cancelled ‘Star Trek Phase 2’. I found the mystery surrounding V’ger interesting and the revelation of it being a Voyager probe a great concept that made for a perfect ending. Many people complained about the film feeling like a normal episode of TOS but with a bigger budget, for me that wasn’t a bad thing. It was exactly what I wanted out of a Star Trek movie as a fan of TOS and managed to capture what made the show great, many people wanted an action film but that isn’t what the show was about. It was instead a slow burning beautiful sci-fi film that kept you engaged with an amazing mystery and universe.

3067,"Part of what made TNG era trek so compelling and ""bigger"" was the fact it started in media res",1599991798,"With the newer star trek series, with the tendency towards one fixed story arc across an entire season, it has the odd effect of making the entire trek universe somehow smaller - and I think that might be the abandonment of using in medias res as a storytelling technique - with TNG and VOY and to a lesser extent DS9 and ENT, the story would begin with the story title and a necessary log entry to bring the viewer up to speed - in other words you had the sense of the story having begun well before and it was as if the viewer had suddenly materialised and had to be given the background story very quickly - the effect was to create a sense of a huge living universe that continues to run if the viewer is watching or not, and continues evolving and changing when the audience went away - and in line with the comfort of TNG made you feel like you were part of the crew, with this story being only a small part of a bigger universe of stories.

As a technique it's very effective, and has been used for centuries - Shakespeare even makes oblique references to events and people happening offstage that don't serve the story at all but act to make the story seem to have connections and sub plots beyond the ones seen on stage. 

Now, does that mean it's perfect? Not at all - as has been pointed out, if you have to wrap each episode ina neat bow, it limits storytelling opportunities for wider arcs, especially in voyager, that could have benefited from larger exploration over an arc - but I think, as DS9 infamously showed, and Battlestar Galactica reboot, that sci-fi benefits from not being one or the other - having a story arc that keeps a wider plot going is great, but with allowance for subplots and diversions within - the model of more classic naval adventures in which you have the super objective (to get home, to deliver a message, to save something, to explore strange new worlds) with inevitable weekly distractions and, crucially, andis offering the more mundane aspects of running a ship for multi years missions.

Discovery is terrible at this and the result is the whole story arc feels like just one long episode but it has the odd effect of making the story seem smaller, with everything in the universe happening in relation to this one vessel. It would benefit to have a sense of things they are doing when the audience is not watching. It's what gives the characters a strange need to give speeches, rather than just be ""themselves"" and allow us to be a fly on the wall. 
 This may exactly be the thrust of what they are attempting to recapture with the ""side"" series of short treks, lower decks, and strange new worlds. Here's hoping!

EDIT: it's ""in medias Res"" I can't change the title now.

Further edit: I'm not using the term in medias Res properly. Think of it as me gesturing towards the point, that we see smaller parts of wider stories.",startrek,troutmaskreplica2,False,/r/startrek/comments/irvoz3/part_of_what_made_tng_era_trek_so_compelling_and/,0

As Tilly is infected by the spore they seem to treat it as an alien invasion to her body and first Stamets idea is to suck it out of her and then they act like its a super hostile force so they make a forcefield around it etc. Also the spore is acting very dramatic.

The spore being dramatic is ok since it is trying to communicate to Tilly something is destroying its world. It is asking for help. And Discovery response? It is a dangerous thing they treat aggressively before even properly investigating. Despite the fact it is THE goal of starfleet to seek new forms of life. This is even a form they sort of know and stamets should love to talk to.

Yes, they communicate and help the spore at the end, but first we need to get that non starfleet drama aproach. And thats where other trek shows I feel would go differently about it. Especially when its a form of life that communicates and asks for help.

* The use of the holodeck as like a giant 'nutshell study' (a crime scene recreated as a dollhouse for further examination after the original scene is cleaned) is a genius idea (""A Matter of Perspective"").
* I'm beginning to think that a season without Q is an incomplete one, as so far he's been in at least one per season; this one was spectacular and rather redeeming (""Deja Q""). He's still annoying though!
* ""Sarek"" hit particularly close to home, with the whole 'mental degeneration with old age / losing your self to incurable illness' thing being one of the things I especially fear.
* I have a feeling I would probably end up in the same situation as Lt. Barclay and spend too much time in a holodeck simulation where everything goes my way and end up late for real life things (""Hollow Pursuits"").
* It was fun seeing Tasha Yar again, even if for one episode (""Yesterday's Enterprise"").
* From everything I've read on various sites, ""The Hunter"" isn't too far from how  war veterans (American at least) are treated IRL - expected to be able to just turn off their training and PTSD and become normal, 'productive' citizens without needing support upon discharge.
* Despite knowing that everything turns out ok - because I have the rest of the series on my computer - the cliff hanger at the end of ""The Best of Both Worlds pt1"" is still tense!

Kirk was a rash captain who would sleep with almost everything, Spock never showed emotion and would tell everyone to “live long and prosper” and that whenever the away party wanted to return to the Enterprise they would say “beam me up Scotty!” I also heard that the show looked cheap and fake, causing you to not be able to properly invest yourself in what was happening, which after watching the show I can confirm is 100% wrong.

The first thing that blew me away was the sense of scale the show was conveying. As a modern viewer I was used to shows like Game of Thrones or Westworld that had millions of dollars spent on every episode to make their world feel real, what amazes me is that TOS manages to do that with a tiny amount of those shows budgets. The enterprise bridge feels real, with every button having a practical use. Each planet feels like a strange alien world, just through the use of some alien ruin prop and fog to cover up the background. Each race feels unique and memorable, not because of fancy special effects, but because you can tell they poured their souls into crafting a sci-fi universe out of whatever they could find in the studio lot. I think what helped my enjoyment of the show was understanding the context of how it was made. I knew that this was 1960s TV and my expectations were set for that, if you made someone who has never heard of Star Trek they would probably think it was a terrible cheap looking joke. 

The main thing that really elevates TOS to the masterful show it is, are the characters. As mentioned before I had the wrong idea about some of the characters (due to the JJ Abrams movies) so was surprised by how good they were in this show. Kirk is a level headed captain, how can outsmart his enemies, charm anyone if needed and can hold his own in a fight. Shatner also manages to carry most episodes, he knows when to act seriously and when to go all out screaming to the sky. McCoy is probably my favourite character, who always gets the funniest lines with his interaction with Spock. However it was Leonard Nimoy who really blew me away. Spock isn’t just a one note character who has no emotion, being half human Spock has struggled his whole life to control his emotions, and Nimoy delivers that struggle perfectly throughout.

Finally the overall quality and variation of the episodes and world building was superb. One week you are watching a pure 60s episode of TV as an evil Kirk roams the enterprise in pure campiness. The next week it’s a nail biting edge of your seat episode as the Enterprise battles a Bird of Prey in submarine warfare, or a comedy episode about tribbles, a love story about two people separated by time. Star Treks diversity of episodes keeps it feeling fresh and allows a modern viewer to go through the show and be able to watch what they want without missing an overarching story. Throughout the show you also get slowly introduced to a larger universe, from Starfleet to WW3 and the Romulan war, it makes this universe feel alive and encourages you to watch more, to find out about its history and discover strange new worlds with the cast. 

If you’ve actually read this to the end then I’d love to hear what your favourite episodes are, for now though, I get to watch the motion picture.",startrek,ben111567,False,/r/startrek/comments/ira367/what_its_like_watching_tos_for_the_first_time_in/,0

Pike: this character seems to have gotten overwhelmingly positive response. While I'm not claiming there aren't any people that didn't like him, I don't recall seeing any real negative reaction myself.

Saru: very similar to above. I have pretty much only seen positive response to this character and don't recall seeing any real negative response.

So, what if Vulcan telepathy and katras are not actually naturally evolved traits? We know that they had a massive amount of technology at the point when they glassed their planet. What if when the survivors descended into the bunkers and caves to escape the radioactive fallout, while some people like Surak were off developing a philosophy of logic, other survivors decided to create a tool that would allow them to read each other's minds to prevent them from wasting their limited resources on more war? Or alternatively, maybe it was a bioweapon, a form of nanotechnology that was supposed to destabilize the minds of those who were infected and cause insanity and death.

3214,Reimagining the Aliens/Evolutionary creature study: Tellarites,1599777826,"Again, more pics in the link, [here's what I got!]( **Tellarite Evolution**



Before I can go into anything else I need to share the [aquatic ape hypothesis]( We already know they are exclusively herbivorous, and that their blood contains Hemerytherin which we are told is a protein found in deep sea creatures. And the more I thought about them complaining about the temperatures in ENT and these small factoids made me think it would be really fascinating if Tellarites were actually more closely related to aquatic mammals rather than apes, pigs, or the like. Something closer to whales or hippos, and the way I constructed their anatomy reflects this change.






Tellarites were very adapted to water. Their ancestors had massive upper torso fins that developed nail-like structures to uproot stubborn underwater leaves which enabled them to crawl easier on land once their food supply became scarce in certain areas. Rather than undergoing some cataclysmic event, the Tellarite ancestors are overfeeders, and likely would overeat their diet in the water until there was little left and scavenge on land until the food supply would become more depleted there as well, thus creating a consistent back/forth seasonal feeding cycle for the plants to regrow on land and sea. As time went on, they found more and more food on land, and eventually settled there.





**Tellarite Anatomy**


Tellarites are definitely one of the least attractive species and one of the easiest to not make humanoid so I jumped at the chance for it. Designing them was somewhat tricky - I obviously needed the boar face, and needed them to be intimidating, but capable of bipedality and quadripedality, and I figured the design of gorillas with pigs together would be something interesting to explore, especially if they were more closely linked to a hippo-like creature than apes.





Tellarites don't have forearm bones, they have fingers that extend through what we know as our forearms, ending in the ""nail"" or hooves. The hooves remail extendable as they were useful to scrounging at the bottom of the ocean for plant life to uproot, and while their ancestors never quite had ""fingers proper"" their arms functioned more like fins in whales. Their internal organs are nearly all located in their belly with a large chest cavity to accommodate their expanding lungs which can grow up to 4-5x their exhaled size making it useful to remain underwater for extended periods of time. Their two stomachs enable better digestion for leaves and underwater plant life, and their tails and smoother spine are vistigial remnants of necessary speed when swimming




Also pictured are the multiple nipples which are equal in both males and females, and though only the women can give birth, both may nurse. The last drawing is of a young unbearded female nursing 2 of her pups while using her extended tongue to reach tree plant life, again a useful trait to have on land when no longer in water and not the most adept at climbing. Though Tellarites have smaller brains, this has no effect on cognitive ability and they're quite adept at engineering. Though fully capable at bipedality, their walking is awkward and uncomfortable, and they prefer to walk on all fours when possible.






Lastly, their claim to fame is how incredibly rude they are. This is entirely cultural and has no basis in their biology or evolution, and became a culturally evolved trait combat overeating and scarcity of food as they began to become civilized and lived longer. Tellarites aren't the best at farming and rely on the overabundance of plant life on their planet and culturally evolved fighting and rudeness to maintain healthy and sustainable population size. Lastly, their tusks are purely a product of sexual selection and are present in both males and females, though males typically have larger tusks.

What if Gowron was killed by an unfortunate console explosion on his ship. Founder-Martok assumes full control of the fleet and presses home the attack. 

The Starfleet reinforcements come in firing and we have a war pitting the Klingons against the Federation and Cardassia. 

I think a lot depends on how long the Dominion holds back before invading.  Based on how DS9 was chewing up the Klingon fleet, I think DS9 would have survived the battle but with heavy damage. 

The Klingons would have probably won for a while until Starfleet fully mobilised, but would then have struggled on two fronts.

3229,Immersive Star Trek Watching - The Best Way to Watch?,1599769228,"As a star trek fan, I am always on the look out for the best experience in terms of watching trek. 

Technology has moved on in leaps and bounds in recent years. There have been star trek remasters into HD and fans have also pushed the technology envelope to create the best versions of trek even when official HD versions are not available. In particular, I am thinking of stunning efforts such as this one for DS9: 

 I believe that this has been posted here before recently, but I have been following the author's progress for quite some time now. Indeed, previous posts by the author got me interested in some of the tools being used, for example Avisynth+ and I have started playing around with enhancing some of my own video content (wedding videos etc.). 

At this point, I would highlight that one of my other interest areas is Virtual Reality. I have an Oculus Quest VR headset which is quite an amazing device for watching VR content and 3D films (Blueray 3D derived content through the headset is jaw dropping, e.g. Star Trek into Darkness).

I have discovered through these interests that you can convert 2D content into 3D content using Avisynth+. I have posted about this before on reddit:
  So, cutting to the chase, what I have been able to do is extend the approach described for remastering DS9 in close to HD to actually create an HD 3D version as well. This is achieved quite simply by extending the Avisynth+ scripts described in the original DS9 remastering post with the 2D to 3D conversion script elements that I describe in my post. 

What you get is an immersive 3D version of trek that you can view at whatever scale you like in a VR headset (if you have one) - (or on a 3D TV - but that is a little old now I guess).

I have created a couple of proof of concept 3D SBS videos below to view. One is of the DS9 Intro sequence with the Space Station. The other is a short live action sequence from the start of Season 2 Episode 2 (first 30 seconds). Unfortunately, I am not an expert on posting videos. I have put these up on streamable - but it has reduced their horizontal resolution from 2560 pixels (SBS) to 504. If someone can suggest a better hosting location I can put them up there. You can view them in the Oculus browser (set the viewer to indicate that they are in 3D). 

I watch the originals of these in SkyBox player in 3D SBS mode - with the aspect ratio set to 4:3. The 3D effect works really well - surprisingly so. These very much reduced resolution examples are at least sufficient to show that I think. 

I can provide more information and the script that I used if people are interested. If Star Trek fans with a headset want to check these out please do - I apologise again for the reduced resolution.

I liked Discovery, I felt it kept itself moving and even if it did less exploring than I hoped for (especially for a show called...Discovery), I thought the arcs worked really well.

Then I was in the mood for some classic trek so I rewatched Enterprise...well, the last 2 seasons and the good parts of season 1-2. And it feels *bizarre* when the massive, galaxy-shattering events of the Xindi war are interrupted for an episode where we beam down to a planet for no reason and the crew is transformed into an extinct talking dinosaur species. Like what the hell guys?!

I know people really like their episodic stuff, and I probably enjoy arcs more than a lot of fans—Babylon 5 is my favorite Sci Fi show. But how discovery handled arcs felt really right. Enterprise taking a pitstop at ""kill and revive a crewmember in 1 episode"" station every 3 episodes while Earth is at stake sits really weird with me. And I feel like Discovery managed to use their B plots effectively to explore a lot of the more episodic, not-arc-friendly kind of stuff.

Also, consumption related rather than anything else, but I feel like consistent story arcs make a lot more sense for Discovery because basically no one is watching random out of context episodes, we're all watching it the whole way through.

Supporting evidence:
-Foodstuffs are inorganically materialized from transporter patterns 
-The most verbal mentions of bathrooms are on ENT and DS9, where they would logically be more common because of replicators not being used yet (ENT) or organic food being more readily available due to proximity to a planet (DS9)
-Jonathan Frankes said offhand there was only one bathroom on the D (i know there are images of a door labeled ""head"" off the bridge) but the point is that there are much fewer of them because most people on long range or exploration vessels are eating replicated food.

**Episode 6 - ""Terminal Provocations""**

* Boimler attempts to imitate the engine sounds of various starships. There is an ever-present ambient humming/pulsing sound in the background of many scenes in the franchise, and its ""soothing"" nature has inspired hours-long Youtube white-noise videos.
* The Drookmani are salvaging a vessel of the same design as the cargo drone ships in ""More Tribbles, More Troubles."" The design was retroactively used for the previously-unseen *Antares* in the remastered version of ""Charlie X,"" and the derelict's registry NCC-502 is one higher than that ship.
* The Drookmani's captain is voiced by JG Hertzler, whose varied Trek credits include General Martok, hero of the Dominion War and Chancellor of the Klingon Empire.
* The captain also sports an eye patch, which is clearly a reference to the panhandler in ""False Profits.""
* Shaxs continually suggests destroying the Drookmani freighter, and his advice is continually ignored. Worf suffered from the same malady throughout TNG as Picard preferred a diplomatic solution.
* The *Cerritos*' tractor beam makes the same noise as the one in TNG.
* Fletcher met Boimler at the Academy. The trope of ""old Academy buddy causing trouble"" is recycled again and again throughout Trek, perhaps most obviously with Kirk in TOS.
* Fletcher cites an incident in which Boimler nearly had his heart eaten by Nausicaans. These brutes were introduced in TNG as the Klingonesque troublemakers who fought a young Picard and stabbed him in the heart.
* Rutherford speculates the disputed cargo could contain ""cryo-frozen princesses;"" this is not a specific reference but people have been discovered cryogenically frozen in episodes like ""Space Seed,"" ""The Neutral Zone"" and ""The 37s.""
* Tendi thinks it might be the ""clamshell design"" communicators, evoking the flip-phones from TOS.
* When describing the benefits of holodeck training, Rutherford tediously name-drops famous figures previously seen in holodecks:
 * Sherlock Holmes - ""Elementary Dear Data"" et al.
 * Robin Hood - ""Qp--""...wait, that wasn't the holodeck.
 * Sigmund Freud - ""Phantasms""
 * Cyrano de Bergerac - ""The Nth De--""...wait, that wasn't the holodeck either.
 * Einstein - ""The Nth Degree"" and ""Descent""
 * da Vinci - ""Scorpion"" et al.
 * Stephen Hawking - ""Descent""
 * Socrates - ""Darkling""
* The Deckers have to mess with isolinear cores, which involves pulling out isolinear chips and putting them back in. TNG introduced isolinear chips as technobabble hardware usually serving as the circuitry or guts of a computer.
* The Zebulon Sisters and their Chu Chu Dance are not references, but Mariner saw them on Deep Space 3, a station briefly alluded to in ""Interface.""
* Badgey is more of a reference to external software assistants, but a computer helper was seen in the form of a fish in ""Rascals.""
* One of the plotlines in the episode is the famous ""holodeck gone wrong"" story required by WGA regulations for any series with a holodeck, where the slightest technical glitch elsewhere on the ship results in holograms running amok, turning self-aware and lethal, giving birth to Windows 95 screensavers, etc. The first such installment was ""The Big Goodbye,"" with a forerunner in ""The Practical Joker.""
* The design of the Bajoran marketplace does bear similarities to Bajoran architecture and other cultural references to that world, including the Bajoran ""logo"" used as the commbadge for DS9 crew.
* Freeman calls for evasive pattern Sulu Alpha. Hikaru Sulu, helmsman of the TOS *Enterprise*, knew his way around a fight and eventually became captain of the *Excelsior*, so it's only natural he would have inspired tactical maneuvers.
* Fletcher initially attempts to attack the core with a tool; the tool's design is familiar and is probably some kind of coupler or spanner or something but I'm unable to specify it.
* ""Environment 83"" is a frozen landscape; the broken holodeck in ""The Big Goodbye"" briefly switched to such a place.
* This week's ""Name the Species"" brings us a security officer with a set of forehead ridges/patterns. It is not a Xahean, as he blinks normally.
* Fletcher is reassigned to the *Titan,* presumably under the command of William T Riker heading up the Romulan task force after *Nemesis.*
* The keys to the captain's yacht are attached to a tribble keychain. Tribbles are the furry, cuddly, hungry, horny little breakfast cereals introduced in TOS.",startrek,Antithesys,False,/r/startrek/comments/iq2jpm/canon_references_terminal_provocations_spoilers/,0

3267,"In Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, why were there complications when returning to the 23rd century?",1599699702,"Spock explains his difficulties calculating the trajectory needed for returning to the 23rd century by saying that the acceleration of the ship is ""no longer a constant"". (I inserted the dialogue below.) This is due to the additional mass of the whales and water on the ship. That seems so illogical to me, someone with nothing but high school grade knowledge of physics and talking out of my ass right now. 

First of all, the mass of the whale tank should not be impossible to measure. Since Spock was able to calculate the trajectory to travel to the 20th century with little data, why does having to weigh the whale tank pose such a challenge? Second of all, what does ""no longer a constant"" mean? The acceleration might have changed due to the additional weight, but it was always a variable, never a constant, and if he means to say that the weight has changed thus complicating his calculations, well, why don't they simply weigh the whale tank?! Why would Spock, of all people, rather take a *guess* than perhaps use a weighing device that surely must have existed by the 23rd century?

McCOY: You, ah... You present the appearance of a man with a problem.

3280,Reimagining the Aliens/Evolutionary creature study: Vulcans,1599682722,"[So I started doing this]( One of the things that always bothered me as a kid watching the shows was that the aliens never seemed like aliens. Mostly just normal people with one insignificant change, which of course was due to budget reasons and being implanted with a humanoid seed in the galaxy, but I always thought, ""If the humanoid thing wasn't just around to explain away the budget, and we really did have all we could do, how would these be different?"" It's been a bit of a fun and interesting trek, but I've been toying with it and would love to share.









**Vulcan anatomy**




Vulcans are the quintessential ""alien"" and are closest allies in the Trek lore, and I wanted to show that part of them by going off of the Spirit that Roddenberry wanted which was little green men, but more human. The craniums are larger to hold bigger and more complex brains, their skin tone is more sallow and greenish (which is a reflection of Nimoy's makeup), and they are near universally taller than humans (average is 6'1"" or 187cm) with long fingers. Of course we all know about their pointed ears, which I've determined were more due to sexual selection than natural selection. While still sensitive, the length and position of the ears really doesn't have an effect on hearing for Vulcans.










As for the facial differences, I wanted Vulcans to be beautiful and regal in their appearance, but clearly alien and otherworldly, thus the high cheekbones, thin lips, and furrowed brows. I intentionally made the artistic choice to give them a protruding brow that was reminiscent of our neanderthals and thus big and brutish and not too bright, as was their history. Having something so attractive and logical still bear the marks of a species dominated by their emotions was compelling to me.









Vulcans have tiny nodes on their fingers that are capable of detecting and contracting pheromones, emotional chemicals, leading communicative consciousness factors (I assume they've figured out what consciousness is and that with the right nodes, you can transfer memories to someone else without words). This makes a scientific explanation for mind melds, and for why the fingers and the placement of them on the face is so important. It also helps explain the Vulcan death grip, which does not pinch certain nerves, but rather is a transference of emotional energy that completely disrupts the neural pathways of the victim temporarily.









Regarding Vulcan eyes, I made sure that they seemed cold and lifeless, thus making their eyes completely black except for 3-4 white pupils. In doing so, the Vulcan eyes have a terrifying effect, until looked at more closely, to see the wonder and depth they convey. Like stars in the night sky!








The rest of the anatomy is just riffing off of ENT. They have a second set of nostrils for pheremone detection (T'Pol mentions how much more sensitive Vulcans are to smell) and both nostrils are small to avoid dust inhalation on a nearly exclusively desert planet. This is also why they have two sets of eye lids, the second transparent and allows for seeing in sand storms. Lastly, as I'm a bit of a weirdo when it comes to Trek sexual organs because I'm fascinated from an evolutionary perspective how this all works, so I depicted no visible testicles, only one actually existing behind the bladder that continues to produce sperm that, if build up too much, will seep into Vulcan bloodstream and cause death. Their penis has ridges due to sexual selection and the women have no labia minora, and multiple clitoris that line the inside of the vaginal wall (thus the ridges in the men) but otherwise remain relatively similar to human sexual organs.








**Vulcan Evolution**

Vulcans as a species don't fit neatly into the human understanding of primates. They are certainly mammals, but their closest relatives would be something more akin to reptiles in their cold-bloodedness, scales (which they no longer have), and reptilian rationality in terms of emotional processing (which remains low. The disadvantage to this is that Vulcans are not good at keeping emotions as they cannot process them and think coherently at the same time. The advantage is that they are called of fully suppressing their emotions and engaging only in logical thinking). Whereas on earth humans could've only evolved after a hot and deeply tropical world cooled off, the opposite is the case for Vulcans. Their ancestors were already fairly well adapted herbivores and capable of bipedality, but due to a little understood catastrophic event, the planet became more arid and desert like, forcing Vulcans to adapt to the increase in dust and decay. This also helps explains why Vulcans are generally less inclined to form communities than humans are, as their environment typically favored scavenging for plant life in an already harsh climate. This enabled them to become slightly more omnivorous, though there are certainly variations of the communal/dietary aspect depending on the location of the population.








I didn't feel like I could devote any more time to their culture and music and religion which.is too vast to discuss and other things could handle that better than I could. I just wanted to give a different take on them and I intend to do so for several species. Tellarites are tomorrow and after that, Andorians.

3293,Lower Decks: thought after the first episode,1599668782,"Before I get to this scene in Lower Decks, I want to rewind a moment for context.

One of my favorite sitcoms is Community.  One of the things I loved about it was how it was able to make jokes with and at the characters, but (usually) not at the expense of the characters.  And how it was able to treat parts of nerd culture with depth instead of just punchlines.

Case in point is that they did two episodes involving playing D&amp;D.   On other sitcoms, like Big Bang Theory, D&amp;D was the punchline.  “Yeah, but *you* play D&amp;D.”

In Community, in both episodes they made fun of some of the tropes, but also use the form of storytelling to allow characters to have real emotional moments, such as reconnecting an estranged father and son.


What does this have to do with Lower Decks?

In the pilot, “Second Contact”, Rutherford is on a date when the zombie outbreak happens.   He and Ensign Barnes manage to escape behind doors and have a passionate kiss.  He’s then totally distracted by wondering why the doors didn’t open correctly for their comnbadges.   She is annoyed that he cares more about that then the moment they shared.  

Later it shows they broke up, because he doesn’t understand why that wasn’t interesting to her.   In his words ‘Who has time for romance when there’s a level two diagnostics waiting to be run!”


In most shows, I would expect this to be the joke.  For the other characters to laugh at him, and point out that he needed to put aside his passion for discovery and engineering and connect with the hot woman.  (Honestly, I would even expect that to be the joke on The Orville which I love.)

But this is the moment where *Lower Decks* felt like true Star Trek to me.  The person he’s talking to reacts with a startled “What!” And then continues *agreeing* with him.

The joke isn’t look at this dork, the joke is the bait and switch of thinking that she’s going to react one way when she actually agrees.

My profession is a QA engineer, and this passion for making sure that the tools and products actually work the best is what I see daily on the best people in my job, and something I have myself.   It’s what drives us to working late or weekends, because if there’s anything that slips that we could have caught, I don’t care about stock prices or critical reception.  I care about making the product I spend my life working on the best it could possibly be, period.


Our crews, our heroes on Star Trek aren’t driven by greed (except Quark), or lusts or any of that. (Riker may have that as a motivation, but not his driving force.)

It’s that passion for doing something right, for discovering what’s out there, for science and for being the best you can be - that’s not a joke, but part of the core ethos of Star Trek.

The show is far from perfect, and could go many different ways.  But moments like that make be at least believe that the core is correct.   The humor isn’t everyones style - it’s not even completely my style.  I think they could dial it back about 20-30%.

They pretend to be rational, but they are people with unbalanced anger, unreasonable paranoia and uncontrollable arrogance. They have even got a Nixon's response to AIDS episode, were they refuse to cure a deadly disease because they disagree with the telepathic (gay) ""lifestyle"".

(apparently the doubledick was canon before that discovery scene, which is, you know. thanks rick burman, very cool)

so do females have two vaginas leading to two wombs or to the same womb? or do they just have the one but they have two clits? Cuz like the clitoris exists in humans bc the fetal nerves that would grow out into a penis don't grow into that and just chill there instead, so if we assume that all the humanoids have roughly analogous evolutionary paths, which is a reasonable assumption since our galaxy was [seeded by ancient humanoids]( see, the relationship between the clit and the penis—that they grow from the same cluster of cells in the fetus—is true for the vagina and testicles. In fact, if you have testicles, that seam down the middle is what would have been the opening to your vagina if you'd gotten different genetic information from your parents. Which is to say, *if we can deduce the nature of the klingon nutsack, we can understand the nature of klingon pussy.*

you ever have one of those moments where you realize what you've been doing for the last hour and wish you could stop but you've already invested so much time that you have to see it through? Yeah.

rather than 
&gt;o o

so my guess is that there's probably just the one sack underneath both of the dicks (although who KNOWS how many testes they have, what with Brak'lul and all that), which would imply that there's just the one vagine as well.

After the back-to-back blows of 2003’s Nemesis being terrible and ENT ending on a middling note, the Trek franchise would remain dormant until 2009’s JJ Abrams reboot, and 2017’s Discovery. This timeline, the one we’re living in, now sees no less than five Star Trek shows about to be sharing an audience, three high grossing (if underwhelming to some) movies, and a reinvigorated franchise (that some of you no doubt hate, but that’s a different topic). 

Discovery’s new season features our crew lost in time, to the 32nd century. In this time, the Federation has all but collapsed, in the wake of a disaster known as the “Burn.” Discovery, having the spore drive and a crew of Starfleet officers still deep in the Federation spirit, sets out to unify the splintered Federation. 

Cool concept, I think it’ll be great, and I’m really excited. However, there’s a world in which we got this story ten years ago: enter, Star Trek: Federation, a show penned in concert by Robert Meyer Burnett and Geoffrey Thorne. Let’s run down some plot points, courtesy of this [Trekmovie article from 2011]( -	The way the team proposed shaking up that universe was to move the action to the year 3000 with a different United Federation of Planets. In Federation the UFP is still espoused to be a civilization of alien races united in respect living in a “Golden Age of Peace”, but not all is well...
-	Earth’s Humans have become “fat and happy” but this has led to complacency where humans are “giving up exploration for incremental colonization and focusing more on the rightness of their own cultural view over all others”
-	Many younger members of the UFP have left, eschewing this “human-centric” Federation
-	Starfleet has been reduced to a “mere peace-keeping force” protecting fringe worlds from aliens and from fighting each other, with starships are old and spread out too thin
-	The ship is described as not being too big “something bigger than Voyager, but nowhere near the size of The Battlestar Galactica”. 

Sound familiar? Now, let’s take a look at a contemporary competitor series, which was being developed for StarTrek.com around the same time: [Star Trek: Final Frontier]( Final Frontier was set in the 26th century, so a bit closer to contemporary than Disco S3. In Final Frontier’s setting, the Federation went to war with the Romulans, resulting in the wide scale use of weapons based on the Omega molecule, resulting in the Federation being decimated and splintered apart as warp travel became essentially impossible across vast swathes of space. The Federation turned insular, Starfleet became fully militarized, and the future became bleak...until the new captain of the newest Enterprise decided it’s time to get back to the roots of exploration, diplomacy, and adventure. 

Again...sound familiar?

Neither of these projects took off (though, Final Frontier was an official ST project with a fully fleshed out story, concept art, and scripts, all of which can be found [here]( It seems like, along with fellow Roddenberry baby, Andromeda, Discovery has found inspiration in these defunct series. So, while we never got the revival of Trek on TV in the late 2000s, maybe we’ll get to see something like it, now. And, maybe, it won’t suck.

3354,"In relation to the episode ""Far Beyond The stars"" I want to share my favorite piece of Comic Book History.",1599595495,"an Excerpt from David Hajdu's The Ten Cent Plague:  


The last comic book EC would ever publish was the February 1956 issue of Incredible Science Fiction, issued in November 1955. Feldstein, the editor, submitted the pages to Charles F. Murphy late in the summer of 1955. “Murphy always read our stuff himself,” Feldstein said. “I’d go in there with the pages, and all the little old ladies were reading everything else, and I’d have to wait until Murphy personally read our pages.” That issue of Incredible Science Fiction included a story, written by Jack Oleck and illustrated by Angelo Torres, about mutants. Murphy rejected it outright. “You can’t have mutants,” he said, as Feldstein remembered.

“So I went back to the office, and I said, ‘Bill, what are we going to do? We got a deadline.’ He said, ‘Well, let’s pull out an old one’—one that we already used before the Code but was clean enough to pass. So I dug out one of my favorite pieces.” Written late in 1952 and originally published the following spring, the story, “Judgment Day!” was one of what Feldstein called his “preachies”; a science-fiction allegory about race, it followed an astronaut from Earth as he inspected a planet populated by self-replicated robots, some painted orange and some blue, but identical mechanically. When the Earthman saw that the orange ones had subjugated the blue ones to poverty and servitude, he declined to welcome the robots into the galactic union. The last panel of the story showed the astronaut back in his spaceship; with his helmet removed, we see that he is black-skinned. “In the 1950s, when I wrote it, that was a pretty strong message,” Feldstein said. “You know, a message of hope for the future of what was then a terribly segregated society.” Indeed, when “Judgment Day!” was first published the Chicago Defender devoted an editorial to recounting the story, which the newspaper praised for combining “the lure of color and fantasy with educational propaganda.”

Murphy read the pages impassively. “He got to the last panel,” Feldstein said, “and he looked up at me, and he said, ‘No. You can’t have a Negro.’

“I said, ‘Why not?’

“He said, ‘You can’t have a Negro.’

“I said, ‘Where in the Code does it say that I can’t depict a Negro?’

“He said, ‘I say you can’t have a Negro.’

“I said, ‘That’s the point of the whole story.’

“‘No.’

“So I said, ‘Bye.’”

Feldstein returned to the EC office and protested to Gaines. “I said, ‘Bill, this is impossible. It just can’t work. They are after our ass, and they’re going to find any excuse to give us a hard time.’ And Bill called up Murphy and said, ‘What the hell is going on?’

“And Murphy said, ‘You can’t have a Negro.’

“And Bill said, ‘Okay. I’m going to have a press conference, and I’m going to tell the public that the comic-book authority is a racist authority that will not permit black people to have equal depiction’ or something like that.” After a pause to reflect, Murphy granted Gaines permission to publish the story, on the condition that the beads of perspiration on the black astronaut’s face be removed. (Feldstein’s text ended with a purple flourish: “And the instrument lights made the beads of perspiration on his dark skin twinkle like distant stars …”) Gaines said, “Fuck you,” hung up on Murphy, and published the story intact.",startrek,Jedi_Knight_TomServo,False,/r/startrek/comments/ip1087/in_relation_to_the_episode_far_beyond_the_stars_i/,0

CBS quote not mine: “The first transgender character is Gray, portrayed by Ian Alexander. Gray is empathetic, warm and eager to fulfill his lifelong dream of being a Trill host, but he will have to adapt when his life takes an unexpected turn.”   

Me: Dax, well yes and no 

Also me: Quark literally changed his body to become a female for plot. 

Also me again: that M-113 creature that can shape shift and also the founders. Yes they can “physically” change there form. 

Me again: hears the mention of “The Last of Us part two” why the... 💀
  
Me again for another time: in the last episode of TOS there was a scene of Kirk getting his essence forcefully put into a woman!

Then captain Georgiou came and offer a chance to Saru to leave his home planet. But how can she do that despite the Prime Directive?

First of, Saru’s people well below a warp tech civilization and the Prime Directive dont allow to start first contact with them. Second, she is violated the spacefaring Ba’ul territory, without permission landed on their planet and intervene with their culture. Third, the Ba’ul see the Kelpiens as their property, so I dont think they allowed her to take away Saru, basically she is stolen from them.

We see many times that the Prime Directive prevent the starfleet officers to help, influence or contaminate other more primitive civilizations and their evolution. Also dont let them to intervene with other species or society is internal affairs and many more things.

3396,The Context of Mariner's Flashback,1599565533,"Lower Decks Episode 5 gave us a wonderful flashback sequence to Mariner's service aboard the USS *Quito*, now revealed to be an *Olympic*-class vessel. The scene depicts Mariner and two friends, Angie and Niko, wearing the FC/DS9 uniforms while Angie shares gossip about the events of the TNG two-parter *Descent*, where Data's brother Lore teamed up with the Borg for some good moustache-twirling villany.

Due to the ongoing debate about Mariner's age and service history within Starfleet, this scene has prompted a lot of debate as to 'when' it takes place, with some arguing that the uniforms benchmark it to somewhere between 2373-2379 (the TNG Movie Era), while others argue that it's set sometime shortly after *Descent* (c. 2370) because Angie is treating the gossip as fresh news. 

The distinction is important because one scenario establishes Beckett has having served at least a decade in the fleet since graduating from the Academy. The other grants more leeway.

I fall among those who feel flashback is not concurrent with the events of *Descent* - I simply can't see the 'First Contact' uniforms being in-service three years ahead of their introduction aboard the *Enterprise*, Starfleet's flagship. Instead I would argue that Angie is presenting her news as 'fresh' in the sense that it is new to her, Niko and Mariner, and her dialogue itself supports this view:

*""Oh! You hear what happened on the Enterprise? Apparently, Data's got an evil twin brother, who teamed up with the Borg.""*

Look at the statement in full. Angie is not just reporting that Lore has teamed up with the Borg, but that Lore even *exists*. That changes everything. Even in a scenario where this flashback takes place right after the events of Descent (c.2370), that part of the news announcing Lore's existance is still six years out-of-date (Lore was introduced in TNG S1, c.2364). 

With that established, it becomes easier to accept the flashback as taking place some years 'after the event', presumably as a result of events regarding Lore having been classified and then leaked out in the form of gossip/scuttlebutt among the ships of the fleet.",startrek,rbdaviesTB3,False,/r/startrek/comments/ios2rz/the_context_of_mariners_flashback/,0

3398,Why Star Trek is helping me with the hardest thing I've ever gone through.,1599564977,"I lost my mom on Wednesday. She was 64, and as far back as I can remember, we watched lots of TOS and TNG as a family, TNG premiered when I was 1 in 1987, so my parents were pretty excited because TNG, obviously.

I think that growing up in that environment helped in developing what I consider pretty good ideals, like learning, exploration, understanding, open-mindedness, and diplomacy.

I am not trying to say I'm a stuck up, holier than thou, elitist, narcissist. I'm not better than any other person, but my parents believed that we could live in a world that could be similar to Star Trek someday, I still to this very day believe that we will get there, or close to something like it.

All that aside, since the 2nd, I have been leaning on and also trying to support my dad and sister, we're all pretty devastated. It's like being ripped in half.

As I now (and have been for a few days) binge and bounce around between series, I'll get nice little memories of my mom here and there, and it's holding me together. The pain of loss is overwhelming, but watching Trek is like a hand on my shoulder. She believed so strongly in the great messages of the series, too many to name here.

This is going to have to be my new life, my new frontier, my voyage in a life without my mom, who has, and always will be, my friend. I will make her proud, by celebrating her life.

Then I jumped into DS9 and paid attention to every episode. If I fell asleep or wasn’t paying attention, I’d rewatch from the last thing I remember as the story arcs were much more important. Next to the EMH, Quark is probably my second favorite trek character.

Moments ago I finished the finale to ENT. As far as the actual show goes, it was brilliant. So many tie ins and little Easter eggs that I noticed that would come into play in (the shows timeline’s) future.

And Kate Mulgrew, whom if I remember, was also one of the writers for a time (don't quote me on that, I do know Jeri Ryan [Seven] did) kinda got in on it and said Janeway changed personalities so many times that she wouldn't be surprised if they went back and said Janeway had some sort of undiagnosed mental disorder the whole time. 

And I didn't mention this because it wasn't relevant to the topic, but what really didn't help was how when a new writer picked up Janeway, they would not just write her the way they wanted to, but kinda overdo it in order to put their foot down, so to speak, and ""solidify"", ""codify"", etc. that this is her personality from then on. Which is all well and good, until the next writer wants to set the record straight and put their foot down, and Janeway's personality gets yanked in a complete other direction.

Anyway, as far as I can tell people generally prefer Archer's Theme to Faith of the Heart. I also feel that Archer's Theme is absolutely fantastic, and even though it has a bit of a different flavour than other Trek themes by including the electric guitar, I still think it would fit in well among the others. Were it to have been Enterprise's theme, I think it still would have been my favourite in the franchise. It sounds grand, and moving, and to me, very ""Trek""... and it should, as it was originally intended to be the opening theme. You can see how well it fits here: [ This whole scenario is very reminiscent of the snafu with the James Bond movie *Tomorrow Never Dies.* KD Lang wrote an absolutely incredible theme called ""Surrender (Tomorrow Never Dies)"", which in my opinion would have been one of the alltime greatest Bond themes, but because Sheryl Crow won a couple of Grammys that year, she was tapped to record an alternate theme called ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", and KD Lang's brilliant piece was relegated to the end credits. Sheryl Crow's song isn't generally very well liked, and is often ranked quite low among Bond themes. Rolling stone pegged it at 16 out of then 22. Any list will have it in the bottom half. 

Check out the differences here:

3425,Infiltration missions and local language,1599525622,"I have spent a good amount of time researching this online and looking for satisfying threads but couldn’t really find a good explanation for this question: in-universe, was it ever revealed how Picard communicated with the Romulans during the infiltration mission that one time? Similar examples include Number One and Troi with the Mintakans, the ENT crew on that world I forgot the name of but it was a pre-warp world, when Kira was turned into a Cardassian and her faux father was supposed to believe that was his real daughter... wouldn’t she have spoken Bajoran? Or at least Cardassian with a Bajoran accent? Or did they have a common language? 

In instances where it’s a federation world, I assume there’s a common language that everyone knows how to speak at least in starship crews, and that there’s a certain number of key languages that everyone must be fluent in. With other worlds that aren’t members or known species but are technologically advanced enough, the use of the translators when available isn’t an issue as they probably have their own devices that do the same thing albeit looking different / being in different locations and forms. 

I am totally willing to suspend disbelief with accents or lack thereof, lack of lag in translation and various minor things that make for better TV and assume in-universe things wouldn’t be as flawless as depicted, that’s fine. 

But plot wise, I feel like we should have had an answer for cases like infiltrations or disguise. If anyone knows, thanks for pointing them out. I wonder if it is known that Picard and maybe the senior staff aboard TNG speaks Romulan fluently, or if an advanced device was made for language issues in infIltration scenarios, or do Romulans speak... English? lol And with the Mintakans I really wanna know, did Riker speak to them in their language without an accent or did he have a translator and how come they didn’t say anything about the translator being in use? Surely they would have noticed and it should have scared them? 

Do translators somehow cancel out the original audio and replace it with translated language in the speakers voice with the perfect accent required to avoid suspicion? And somehow lip movements are ignored? How do the translators anticipate what language the receiver wants to hear without having heard their voice first? Is it then more than audio-space-waves manipulations but some sort of telepathic tech?

3426,Voyager Cast Change - Nix Chakotay,1599525082," A hypothetical for Star Trek fans. Robert Beltran (Chakotay) reportedly did not enjoy working on Voyager, reportedly he signed up to work with Janeway's original actor and didn't get along with Mulgrew. As the story goes, he rebelled by intentionally acting wooden and at one point demanded an exorbitant pay raise in an attempt to be fired from his contract but got the raise instead.

In Scorpion, Harry Kim was injured with the intention of killing the character as the writers hated him or something, until Garrett Wang was listed as a Top X Sexiest Actors and they ejected Kes instead. (Jennifer Lien initially found out about this by reading the script...)

So... what if they'd nixed Chakotay instead of Kim or Kes and we still got 7 of 9? I'm thinking Paris, oddly enough, would be the new XO. Lots of room for character growth there with the rebellious son making good as well as shaking up the character dynamics.

Though I'm not sure the show would need THREE exterior viewpoint characters with Neelix, Kes, and 7. Never really enjoyed Kes, I mean she was so soft spoken and while she had some good moments (the telepathic attack, Warlord, etc) she was just kinda.... there and worked mainly for exposition.

Granted, perhaps they could still write out Kes and we'd get a new recurring character either as a pilot or perhaps do something interesting like promote Kim to Lt jg and put him at conn and someone like Carey or Rawlins (from the pilot ep) at Ops.

At the start of quarantine lockdown I started Star Trek for the first time. Guided by an expert, we dug in to each episode and gave our 2 cents.

Season 1 is casual. Individual episode descriptions hit at season 2. 

season/ep notes available if you're interested. Ratings out of 4. Side note: i dont play with mind control, body swap or amnesia. Mild spoilers and also riker is super horny.

Anyways, I loved it and thought about sharing the strange journey with others. With Star Trek day closing in, it seemed like the right time.

Klingon war


Space Travelling creature that serves as a vehicle for an ethical dilemma


Time-Travel epsiode with wacky character

All make for a solid number of episodes with a series or season arc, but the show just feels off to me. 


1) Production Value

Production value for this show is real real high compared to previous series, as a result, we are seeing a lot more of the ship and of space. The ship looks wrong as a result, so from the outset, we have a ship that is not what we are used to

Then, the set design is quite varied, and instead of having those few familiar sets, we have some of those plus a ton of other spaces that are new and remain unfamiliar  


2) Camera angles/number and editing

This show, as a result of its production value, has access to way more cameras and editing than the previous shows did, and as a result, the blocking or setup, I don't know the technical terms, are something Star Trek fans are definitely not used to. We are used to single camera one takes where actors look for their mark to stand on the floor and stand way too close to one another in order to be center frame. We are NOT used to 2 or even 4 different camera angles for a single shot and then cutting rapidly and abundantly as each character talks. There are a lot of over the shoulder conversation scenes in this show, and in a show with such heavy expesition, this gets kinda old


3) Tone


I can't tell if the tone of the show is more serious, or the 90s were so long ago those shows feel hokey now, but the charm that a Star Trek episode has where it feels partly serious, partly quirky, and partly kinda dumb, but a dumb you are in on, just isn't there with this show. There is a serious attempt being made by the show to be a good Star Trek show, I can feel it. But I just wonder what it needs exactly to get there. Like Rain Wilson as Harry Mudd is a great choice, and I can totally see that being a TMG episode where some guy with a time device has a vendetta against Picard, but its something about the camera angles, the decisions of who to focus on, the editing, something is making it more serious than it needs to be. 

I guess one thing about those old shows is that it never TRULY felt life or death, like we always knew the Federation would win, but we wanted to know how. How, as Red Foreman says, was way cooler than actually winning. This show seems to have higher stakes by having a more serious tone, also the episodes feel far more connected than previous series. Used to be that ya kinda tuned in each week to see what wacky adventure the gang would get into this time, with only carry-over happening some of the time, now, each episode or event seems like super serious and oh my god he made it out alive but is he okay? 

Used to be, he made it out alive and so yes he is okay. 


4) Klingons. 


I dunno what the vibe on the Klingon change is like, but I hate the Klingons. The enemies have NEVER been this dark and scary. Klingons in previous series were great warriors yes, but it was almost a joke watching them drink themselves silly and sing songs and declare themselves mighty warriors and etc. And now? Oh my god, these monsters are here to hunt down humanity!

&amp;#x200B;

\[Old Trek means ST before &amp; including Enterprise; New Trek means Discovery &amp; beyond\]

**The Style**

Star trek, originally, was a show of curiosity. Mysteries, discoveries, inventions, cultures, phenomena and more waiting to be stumbled upon in the vast expanses of space. What mattered most was what was in space. The romances, the jokes, the relations, the arguments, and the weirdness certainly were an integral part of every episode but remove the space setting and you would've never had a successful show. That isn't the case anymore. Space isn't so mysterious anymore but it isn't so welcoming either. Decades of looking out to the sky to find out that there wasn't much out there. And the fervour of the space race was never carried forward to the 21st Century. Space on its own is no longer interesting (unless you've interstellar level ideas), but instead what happens in space, how we react to it, is the one that matters (See Expanse, Another Life, Origin, The First, etc.). And of course, comedic shows based in space (Space force, Orville, LD, etc.). Basically, even though all space shows are space operas, (old) ST was more a show about space whereas (new) ST was a show about us in space.

**Lengths of Storylines**

And the length of each story has changed too. Having a season-long storyline before 2000s was considered bad/stupid/not preferred because it discouraged people from getting in later. If you're lucky, the show could be replayed or you got your hands on a VHS, CD, etc. But more likely than not you still would've preferred to pay less for more, so the demographic who bought the entire series would be a small percent of those watching the series. Basically TOS, TNG, VOY, LD. Even DS9 &amp; ENT had mostly made episodes with a definite ending. Enter streaming services (or just the internet). You could archive older videos (and add ads if you're money hungry) allowing anyone to join the series at any time. This comes with the added bonus that if the show's premiering, you've basically addicted the audience till the end of the season (or if you're particularly evil, the end of the show). Mainly DIS, PIC, and last episodes of DS9 (&amp; Xindi Arc).

**The Differentiating Factor**

And addressing the (tabooic) social issues of the time was a major point in all Star Trek, if not the differentiating factor from other scifi shows. The 'Golden Age' shows &amp; TOS addressed highly controversial but important social issues (which were mainly person-based) of that time (Kirk's 'womanizing' was meant to take the censors' attention from the more controversial aspects of TOS) and even had dedicated episodes for a single issue (usually using some alien problem similar to what we have/had). The problems now aren't on the scale of the person but on the scale of the people, such as Climate Change, Poverty, Obesity. These are easy enough to emulate, but not so easy in the universe of ST in which these are supposedly eradicated. Not for the lack of trying though with Hugh &amp; Stamets in Discovery and Machine Rights in Picard (one more byte could mean sentience, so...).

**The Flaws (mainly DIS)**

* Michael Burnham's character (Do I need to say more?)
* The continuity craziness. The problem isn't Tech such as holograms (The holograms in TNG are Tactile, the ones in DIS aren't, which is a major difference) as most tech have developed a lot in 50 yrs IRL, nor is it the Klingon (as every show has a problem with it, TNG-Mixed to the side of Dishonorable, DS9- Mostly Honorable, TOS- Villains, ENT- Everything with a side to the anitvillainous, etc) but plain old history (again, Do I need to say more?).
* The existence of too much fan-service.
* Not sure if this is a flaw or not, but almost all sci-fi shows nowadays have their plot based on cataclysmic (galaxy ending) event, with every episode playing some part in advancing towards it. Nothing is thought of the little things, the things that give it life. (Old) Trek had episodes specifically made for comedic relief, other storylines, character development, etc. You had Fair Haven, Tribbles, Q-pisodes, Vic Fontaine, Shore leave, Carbon Creek and more, adding in air of reality &amp; relatability. These no longer exist in New Trek (other than specific shows such as LD), which, I think, is one big mistake in the part of New ST. 

**Why Lower Decks is Different**

And then there is Lower Decks. I haven't seen it yet (damn you CBS for allowing it only in US), so take my opinion with a grain of salt. From what I've seen, most people feel that it's the show that resembles the most to conventional Star trek. But it's the most unconventional of ST too. They have managed to successfully combine the styles of today with animation with humor with (Old) Trek successfully, where others have failed. Still it's one show &amp; one show alone trying to take on the mantle of ST (from how most feel about it), while simultaneously trying on something new. So it alone (or others like it) won't be enough to carry ST forward. 

**Conclusion**

Basically, Star Trek can't survive now with the same formula of previous ST shows. And if nearly destroying the ST feel by making DIS &amp; PIC more like a 21st century space-fi lets Star Trek continue, maybe it's not too bad of a trade. After all ENT was considered bad when it was released but has now ALMOST reached the level of TNG. And almost every Gen Z will have a hard time getting interested in TOS at first. So who knows how it will be perceived a few years from now.

Ultimately change is inevitable. You can either be with it (&amp; change into the uncertain) or be against it (&amp; be forgotten). Maybe you've managed to come close to both like Lower Decks, but in the end the old way of ST just isn't viable anymore.",startrek,DarthMaw23,False,/r/startrek/comments/io7glf/why_discovery_picard_soontobereleased_are_good/,0

Fast forward to now, 5-6 years later, when I decided to give it another “curiosity” watch (essentially because I ran out of shows to binge during quarantine) and I just got surprisingly hooked. I now view the characters completely differently, the story is fascinating, I don’t find it bleak or depressing at all just more complex and simply put: interesting at this point in my life and I just love it. 

What happened? I wonder if I kind of loved it the first time around too but didn’t want to, and repressed it for some reason.

Seeing Jake’s pain play out throughout the whole episode as he went a whole life time trying to get his dad back was agonizing.

The main argument being that you should be able to enjoy any episode even when watched out of order. The other side seems to favor the model supposedly championed by DS9 where episodes can build on one another story-wise. The argument here being that it allows for much greater character development as there is less need to always default to a tabula rasa after 50 mins of show.

I've been on the DS9 side of the discussion usually. But recently I started to re-watch all of TNG in order. Today it was ""Reunion"" and I've been thinking. Why is it that TNG fans claim it would adhere to the TOS formula? That might have been largely true up to season 3 but especially with season 4 I see a lot of plot and character development that would make absolute zero sense when watched out of order.

Take ""Reunion"" for example, it is crucial to establishing who Worf and Alexander are. It also deals with information that the viewer can only have if one did watch the earlier episode introducing Duras.

I'm not complaining. I'm actually delited in finding such nice character development in TNG.

3527,Honest opinions about ST Discovery and Picard?,1599404914,"So I started watching ST Discovery and Picard excited to see new Star Trek shows, but unfortunately in the end I get disappointed with the productions.

With Discovery after a few episodes in noticed that I really dont like Burnham or that the show constantly focusing on her. Despite she is lived in Vulcan and wants to be like them, she is too emotional, have unlogical decissions and makes very terrible things. Literally everything revolves around her and just her alone, other characters dont really matter. Like in the time loop episode we see Burnham and not Stamets who trying to save the ship or season 2 they literally needed to introduce the bridge crew because no one knows their names. They really made her this know at all, smug, praise me and love me character without any redeeming quality. 

The plots, story telling and execution not just not makes sense as a prequel but as a star trek show at all. The Klingorcs and everything about them dont look, dont behave and dont feel like real Klingons at all. How they ended season 1 and made L'Rell the chancellor with that bomb was a cowardly act and ridiculous. An open up and widely known Section 31 makes no sense. The Control taking over the humans and wants to destroy every living things is a meh borg ripoff. Again season 2 also feels like a Burnham show, everything is focusing on her, not just she was the most important character in the last season is mirror universe story arc, but now the Red Angel also just connected to and just about her alone. Literally everyone just throws away their entire lifes to follow Burnham for no reason at all. The fights, space battles, CGI and visual effects more seems like from a star wars movie. I literally rolled my eyes when seen the 100+ shuttles and drones from the Enterprise, its just looked so bad and was too stupid. Making the Discovery incidents a secret and the entire crew is nonexistent was dump and dont solved anything.

Oh STPicard, I can wrote a whole essay how its feels like a cheap fanfiction what's wants to piss over the real Picard is character and legacy. We really dont see anything from the old wise, charismatic and borned leader Picard. This is a mentally and physically old, fragile and broken man with regrets, shame and self-loathing. He literally do nothing in the show just there for be a background accessory, a useless relic and a memberberry. The story has so much unused Chekhov's gun, plot hole and missed opportunity in the end its become ridiculous. What about the hologram AI's, they are for some reason okay, even when we all know that they are just as dangeruos and deadly as androids. What about Raffi is conspiracy theory crazy and junkie theme or her son and his romulan girlfriend. What about how the old romulan space become a lawless no man is land and Seven become a Ranger, whatever is it. Really what about Seven's personality takes a total 180 degree turn and by no means seems like the cold, analytic or self-confident we known. What about Agnes Jurati is a romulan spy and with cold blood kills Maddox and they forget it in the next episode. Everyone is cool with it, wants to be her friend and dont give this killer to the authorities. What about the Borg cube, the liberated exdrones and Seven become their borg queen, yeah they dont matter and written out by a floating space flower. What about the romulan spy and federation traitor Comodor Oh, they really let her go with that many blood in her hands. What about the romulan spy Narek who in the last episode just disappear without any explanation. What about the so feared admonition prophecy and the godly space AI's. There are so much more bad, missed or stupid things we can list them for hours Hugh, Elnor, Itcheb and many more.

They are both a bad dystopian future with a very poorly written plot, bad execution and disconnected story parts. Its feels like the writters dont really understand what made Star Trek great, so it's missing the spark/heart/soul the originals have. They brought back the old characters just to win over the fans, then dont do with them anything or disrespect them is a very bad idea. They really need to let the old characters go to remain them as epic as they were.

Because that show was made over 50 years ago and our definitions of ""futuristic"" simply change over time. When TOS came out, there were no mobile phones yet- nowadays, the concept of a communicator is something you use everyday. 

Touchscreens and Holograms are also something id expect in a sci fi movie nowadays instead of analog controls. Holodeck simulations may have existed in the 2250s already, just not for recreational purposes.

In general i´m fine with retconning some technology, since Star Trek is not supposed to be ""retrofuturistic"".

The two reasons I can think of are:

* The Gorn actor couldn't see out of his mask, so they couldn't really choreograph the same level of fighting with one person blind. But it still feels like some work could have been done with that choreography.
* The point of the fight was to show Kirk could not match Gorn physically, so all of his attacks had to be ineffectual. Combine this with the above, and you've got a blind lizard-man slowly swinging his arms to not actually hurt someone, while Kirk flails pointlessly at Gorn.

One aged mid-30’s, one aged late 70+ explorer. s. 30’s Captain commands a light frigate (design undecided)equipped for 10 year expedition, equipped with trans warp and armored like a battleship. 70 year old explorer has a ship similar in size to the NX-01 (might actually use NX design). It would be equipped with trans warp communications and trans warp powered sensors. It would also be heavily armored and more modernly equipped, be mostly automated and have a crew of 100+-. The Admirals ship would be a heavily modified Excelsior Class, fresh out the space dock and one year shakedown. She would be equipped with the latest in everything to include Borg Tech. 

The 3 ships are jumping to the deepest unexplored sector (Beta Quadrant?). 

Mission: Launch to deep system coordinates, secure sector jump point. Mine system. System by system survey of region and catalog EVERYTHING. Travel at traditional warp after transwarp jump from Earth. Make trade deals or alliance offers where possible. Destroy any threat to the Federation member planets and any non-warp capable planets in the Federation. (Very Vague) (Lets Admiral and Ambassador staff write Federation legal code for newly explored sectors) 

Duration: 10 years. At 10 year mark, fleet will communicate with star fleet and will assess federation leadership. If results are favorable, and ships are to continue mission if not at Earth before termination.

Goal: survey from Sector 001, out 10 years and back to Earth. Transmit Data, refit, and relaunch. Survey would be performed in a 20 degree arch (if you look at the galaxy in 2D). Asses potential allies/ combat threats to future Federation interests.

It could fly at nearly mach II, and while the Mk1 had a combat ceiling of 55,000ft, the Mk2 was expected to be able to reach altitudes of 70,000 ft, putting it close to being on par with the US's current top dog fighter, the F-22 (in those areas).

It also contained a massive storage bay that could be used for bombs, internally mounted missiles, or a huge sensor and surveillance package, unheard of in fighter jets of the era.

The Arrow was truly lightyears ahead of its time.

Amazing, notable, terrible TOS moment 1: S02E11 - Friday's Child. Timestamp 13:33. A guy in solid purple gets stabbed in a battle. What happens next, I predict, is production went to lunch. When they came back, they forgot who got stabbed and replaced him with a guy in orange. They pick back up filming mid-stab and depict the stab with a the sword-in-armpit trick. To be clear: Man in purple runs up, gets stabbed, randomly changes costume color, and clearly has this sword under his armpit.

Amazing, notable, terrible TOS moment 1: S02E21 - Patterns of Force. Timestamp 35:57. The away team finds themselves on Planet Nazi and need to get behind a guarded door. They pose as Nazis filming a propaganda video for the Reich. It becomes immediately clear the plan is to knock out the guards when they get close but they have two guards and only one Vulcan and Kirk could never get the hang of the Vulcan nerve pinch.

I remember one specific episode of Voyager where  (somehow  Paris got back to Earth) and was traveling around the city via his friend's  ""personal site-to-site transporter"". 

This brings up a bunch of security questions. For example, locks on doors or doors themselves would be obsolete unless there was some regulation, monitoring of civilan transporters.   Does every building have a ""personal shield""?

3593,Is Star Trek a Religion?,1599324596,"When I was growing up in the 60's my dad was in the US Air Force. He had some very intense experiences during WWII than made him somewhat religious in a very moderate Christian way. No preaching or church going at my house. 

I think his beliefs got him through some really horrific stuff during the war.

I realized that by 1975 I had become such a Star Trek follower than I had memorized entire  scripts of TOS. Was Star Trek my religion?

I would walk like Captain Kirk. And remain calm as Mr. Spock. I tried my best to have the logical answer and to be as knowledgeable as Spock. But sometimes you had to get in someone's face. I would be all dramatic like Kirk. 

When I was 13 years old I had a hallway in my parents house that I changed to a Enterprise corridor complete with a duplicate intercom station set into he wall and a red light behind recessed plexiglass panels in the ceiling. 

When I was in High School and College I looked like a musician. Long hair. Could have been the drummer for Black Sabbath. No one knew I was a geek except my girlfriend. I was lucky I had a lot of girlfriends. Like you know who. We put on a pretty bad show down there. 

I didn't collect models, I didn't go to conventions. I never wore anything ever that said ST. 

I actually worked in Hollywood and gravitated towards a career simply because the room I was working in was like a starship bridge. I designed it so why not.

I started a business when I was 26 and the biggest problem I had was not realizing people would not work together like Starfleet personnel. Meaning they would be self serving combative and well just normal humans. The politics and back backbiting were horrible and I would alternate between Kirk and Spock to deal with it. Formation L. Stop it? I'm counting on it!. 

For years I had the idea that if I needed to I could remove one circuit card from one sync generator and my entire business would stop functioning. The self destruct mechanism. You may control the ship, but I control the computer. Mine is the final command. 

For decades because I never grew out of it when I would go into important business meetings I would be Captain Kirk. I would say Phasers on stun under my breath. I would hum original music cues from TOS like going into a commercial. This meeting will not last longer than three minutes. 

Star Trek got me through so many bad situations. I would repeat ""The bullets are an illusion"" over and over. ""Don't tell me that again science officer it is a theory it can be done!"" 

To this day when I get in a elevator I say ""Bridge"" and turn the nonexistent turbo lift control. 

And here I am. I have moved to a country that is as close to being stuck on a alien world that has be contaminated by Star Fleet technology as you can get. All I have to do is not let them know who I am. 

The truth is now I am more like Captain Pike watching Vina dance in a Talosian illusion than Kirk or Spock. Or sort of stuck in the Negative Universe or maybe I am the evil Captain Kirk from a transporter malfunction.

 I think I got tired of deciding who lives and who dies.

3595,When I think mutiny should be considered ok,1599324474,"Mutiny, the act of rebelling against a superior officer, whether it be an admiral, captain or senior officer is considered illegal. It is illegal since it could involve killing and it disrupts command, causing chaos. However there is no canon reference when talking about mutiny. (Specifically violations)

\- First of all, I think it shouldn't be called a mutiny but rather command correction (in the case of a mutiny being ok). 

\- Command corrections would require the following:

\- If you think your superior or fellow officer has committed a violation of protocol, check to see if they have even violated a regulation. 

\- Contact a superior officer, whether that be the captain or a flag officer. They will give you temporary power and authority to relieve of duty and send the accused to the brig. 

\- If there is no superior officer available (whether it be a commander in chief, or stranded), contact the next superior officer (e.g. contact your commander if the captain has made a violation). 

\- When performing a command correction, phasers must be set to stun only. Killing the violator or their supporters will result in a stripping of rank and charge of murder. 

\- After a command correction has been performed, a new officer must take their place immediately. 

\- A starship crew should rendezvous at a star base unless instructed otherwise by Star fleet. In case there is no penal colony or starbase available, the accused should be restricted to quarters until otherwise. The brig will be a last option. 

\- You could receive a medal for carrying out command correction and/or a promotion, possibly even taking the corrected's place and rank.",startrek,Status738,False,/r/startrek/comments/in4e8d/when_i_think_mutiny_should_be_considered_ok/,0

I am currently rewatching DS9 for the first time in 10 years and now that I am a coffee lover I have been dying to have a Raktajino. In looking at previous recipes posted in this sub and elsewhere online I found myself somewhat wanting. Something about a spiced coffee drink similar to that of a Pumpkin Spice Latte doesn't quite sit right to me. I am willing to accept that Raktajino may in fact just be a Klingon adaptation of an earth Cappuccino and that the climate on Kronos has lead to beans grown there to have what humans would perceive as a spiced flavor, but I have come up with a different take that fits my head cannon much better.

In my head cannon Raktajino would be similar to the Bulletproof Coffee that we have today! If Klingons were to adapt a human coffee drink, how could it be anything other than that? A high calorie coffee drink that provides you plenty of energy to keep fighting the enemies of Kahless for hours! Below is my recipe for a Bulletproof Raktajino.


15g fresh ground (medium-fine) coffee. I use a darker roast for this drink to provide a little more bitterness, but a medium roast would be good as well. Don't use anything super expensive, but don't use pre-ground Folgers either.

250ml boiling water. I have found that a 60g/L ratio of coffee to water to be the most enjoyable for pour over coffee, but use however much water you want to brew your preferred size cup of coffee.

- Once your coffee is brewed, add the following -

1tsp - 1Tbl Kerrygold Butter, or other high quality butter. This will provide the slight sweetness to the drink. It is best to use a grass fed butter if you want to substitute.

1tsp - 1Tble MCT Oil or Coconut oil.

1 scoop Collagen powder, optional.

- Mix everything together in a blender or using a whisk and enjoy! -

3612,Klingons are not cool,1599308412,"Forget everything you know about Klingons. Now Imagine I was going to describe them to you. 

Klingons are a race that place all importance on hand to hand combat. Most important decisions are made by hand to hand combat. For example: who will rule the Klingon Empire- decided by hand to hand combat, the outcome of legal trials -decided by hand to hand combat, who gets a promotion at work-decided by hand to hand combat. When they go to war, they often use hand to hand tactics. 

Hand to hand combat usually doesn’t have a big role in SF. SF is all about laser guns and whatnot. But it might work. Perhaps the Klingons are like the  Xenomorphs in the Alien movies? Xenomorphs have incredible speed, armour, claws, teeth. Xenomorphs are more than a match for any blaster wielding humanoid. Sorry, Klingons are not like that.  They are just tough humanoids who still die to a single phaser shot. 

Perhaps Klingons have cool high tech melee weapons like chain swords, monofilament blades, or even light sabres? Nope. They use a traditional weapon that makes no sense at all!

Perhaps they have high tech armour, so they can at least get close to the enemies to use their old fashioned melee weapons. Think Dune! They had force field armour in Dune. Nope. Klingons had traditional armour that didn’t protect them for modern weapons. 

Maybe Klingons are weak individually but came in hordes. They came in overpowering numbers. You might shoot ten Klingons but the eleventh Klingon gets you. Nope. 

Klingons seem like a race that values something that is no longer important or useful when it comes to gaining power. 

But somehow we are told that this race is one of the most powerful in the galaxy? 

We think they are cool because that is how they are presented to us. They control a large part of the galaxy because that’s the way it was written not because of any “in universe” reason.",startrek,sithlordbinksq,False,/r/startrek/comments/in06pq/klingons_are_not_cool/,0

3616,What is your biggest Star Trek pet peeve?,1599299975,"I have two main pet peeves about Star Trek and while I'd like to know your own take on them, I'd rather read your own.

The first one is that 9 times out of 10, non-Terran species and non-Federation civilisations are warrior cultures who really like honour. ""We are a race of warriors captain!"" ""We value our honour!"" ""You Federation types are so soft! We are warriors! We are a war-like people!"" ""Honour! We have lots of it! Want some honour?!""

Like, when Starfleet makes first contact with a civilisation and finds YET AGAIN they are a warrior culture who shoot honour up their arms, they must eye roll heard and let out a big sigh ""ugh not another one. What else is new?""

My second one is the apparent fragility of Starfleet's ships. Like, the Federation is supposed to be a galactic superpower with some of the most advanced weaponry and defense systems in the Milky Way. YET, when they come into contact with an equal foe (Klingons, Romulans etc.) or even a 2nd tier or 3r tier power...

Essentially, if you give machines sentience, you have have to give them the rights equivalent to biologically sentient life.  This paradigm shift would crash the economy if the technology was adopted enough. Therefore, the most ethical solution would be to deny machines the sentience that would then require them rights.

But damn Capt Janeway was the fucking worst starfleet captain. She was next level inconsistent, and bent or adhered to the rules depending on HOW she felt about it.

Sure enough her inconsistency is what gave us 7 years of Voyager. For had she not decided to disregard the prime directive, they'd have used the array to get back home. 

That's fine. But then a few weeks/episodes later, they find a civilization with the technology to send them 50,000 light years closer to earth, and that's when she decides to uphold the almighty prime directive. Yeah. Her crew went behind her back and it ended up not working, but she still showed that how she felt/her emotion ruled supreme. And that was evident throughout the series.

Remember the episode where they found Q locked in an asteroid and the other Q bribed her with return to earth if she ruled in his favor? She refused. Her crew didn't know about that conversation. 

She showed numerous times that she was willing to put the lives and well-being of other species and crews before her crew. And as a veteran, that really rubs me the wrong way. I don't know ANY commander that would show his or her troops that their well-being comes second to others

And when Kate Mulgrew came on, she was an established actress and had the power to decide the direction of the show. She had a significant say in the series, so I credit her for part of the story.

Rewatching both seasons to refresh my memory ahead of season 3. Some things are much better than I remember from the first time around, others are worse.  


**The good:**  


The Klingons -  yes they look different but I actually really like the way they start of as a shattered empire of multiple warring clans. It would be really cool to see how they got to that point. My had canon is that all the different houses separated from each other after the events of Enterprise in order to maintain their racial purity. By not mixing with other houses they were not at risk of spreading the augment DNA which had infected the Klingons in Enterprise. This had the effect of resulting in a degree of inbreeding which is accounts for their more extreme look (yes this is only my headcannon but I think it sits nicely in the existing lore).  


The interactions between the crew - Some of the scenes and dialogue between the main cast members are really well done. The characters immediately feel more fleshed out and real than in the early episodes of the other series  


The concept: An experimental ship developing top secret tech to win a war is a seriously great direction for Trek to take. I admit the spore drive was a bit ""out there"" even by Trek standards and it's a shame they got too caught up in the specifics of it because they really had the potential to mix the best of DS9 and TNG with the basic premise of the series.  


**The bad:**

&amp;#x200B;

The Starfleet justice system - It makes absolutely no sense how Michael was sentenced to life imprisonment and blamed for starting the war.  Yes she briefly mutinied and assaulted her captain and that should be punished for that but she was in no way responsible for starting the war. The Klingons entered Federation space and fired the first shots. The fact the Capt Georgiou eventually came to see that Michael was right and agreed with her plan to try and capture T'kuvma partially vindicates her and the fact that members of the Shenzhou crew witnessed this yet none of them spoke up for her at her trial and those who went on to serve on the Discovery apparently still resent her for something which they saw was not her fault just seems like they had to trim some important exposition from the script to get to that point. Likewise the trial itself seemed a bit clandestine with the Starfleet judges sitting hidden in the shadows passing judgement as if trying to intimidate and interrogate the accused rather than simply trying to get to the facts of the case, just doesn't seem like something that would happen in the Federation, heck even the Klingon and Cardassian trials we have seen didn't resort to such tactics.  


The spore drive: I have no problem with them developing an experimental propulsion drive that allows them to teleport around the galaxy but the way they explain how it works and the whole Physics = biology bit seems a bit too fantastical even by Trek standards.  


&amp;#x200B;

I remember going to my friends house who had a [bigger TV than mine]( It may be hard to understand, but a running story line with MUST-SEE episodes was essentially unheard of in 1998. And of course nothing was on-demand, so it was a week of anticipation, which was absolutely electrifying.

I'm writing about this, because this episode in particular (along with 2 or 3 other DS9 and Voyager episodes, which I'll elaborate on if anyone is interested) has a vivid place in my memory, and I'm wondering if anyone else watched it live and experienced the same emotions I did.

Somehow, in the years since it's aired, the Senator Vreenak scene ""it's a faaaaake"" has become a minor meme.  But I VIVIDLY remember seeing it live, and my heart SANK when he said that.  I got that same feeling you get when you just got busted for something.  I thought WE were FUCKED. It went to commercial after that and I remember being like ""holy shit, what the fuck is going on?? The good guys are supposed to WIN"".

And I also remember hearing Vreenak died in the shuttle explosion and being like ""WTF?"" and when Garek admitted to killing him instantly, my friend and I were just awestuck that killing the Senator had been Garek's plan all along.  It was simply jaw dropping.

I've lived 22 years on this earth since that episode aired.  That's nearly twice as long as I was alive at the time it aired, and I still remember the feeling I felt when Sisko got busted in the ""it's a faaaake"" scene.

First off there's to many mono cultures, to many alien races are a bit to monochrome in how they are represented not enough chaos in their cultures to allow diverse clothing, styles, genders, races and political ideals. Ds9 did wonders for the cardassians, Klingons and ferengi but tng barely scratched the surface.

Secondly we have a federation with so many humans serving in starfleet where are the boleans and all the other countless races the enterprise only had 13 races represented on enterprise? Yet disco seems more diverse all I'm saying is martok saying that ""Klingons, humans, and romulans"" coming together was a momentous occasion hits harder cause martok says it like he's acknowledging humanity as the head of the federation.

Lastly were are all the half humans, or other half aliens there's no way we don't have half vulcan/half Klingons out there.

All I'm saying the next star trek series should have a half human as the captain and not just half human/vulcan/Klingon but something more exotic.

I love how they modified the bridge with extra stations, and the uniform collars for the whole cast.  

I was like 11 when TNG started and when Denise Crosby got killed off in season one, even though I didn’t know anything about any of it but I sensed it was abrupt.  So when she reappears in the episode I remember it being a real TV thrill.  Then Shooter McGavin hits on her 😘

Guinan is an amazing catalyst for the episode, basically in this alternate timeline where Picard is a hardened battle commander she’s almost his mystic.  When she first tells him everything is wrong he takes it deadly seriously even without a single fact.  

But Picard’s greatnesses is full on display.  He collects the series of events for how the Enterprise-C came to the future and instantly understood the potential impact of restoring the timeline.  Then the senior staff thinks he’s batshit when he tells him his plan to send C back in time on a suicide mission but he talks them down and leads them, period.

It’s nice meeting Rachel Garret and the Ambassador, wish we could have seen much more of it in later Treks.

Then the scene where Yar asks for a transfer and it just becomes this convergence of all the threads of the episode.  It’s a really powerful TNG scene

Just wanted to know what you guys thought about Recent Trek's CGI (by recent, I mean basically anything ST:2009 and later)? 

Personally, I find it hard to pin down why everything just feels so flat and uninteresting, for the most part. I'm not saying 80's and 90's Trek had world-beating effects, but there was something so majestic and tactile about, say, the TMP drydock scene, or the opening fly-by of the E in First contact (physical models are awesome). 

For contrast, I remember seeing Rogue One in 2016, and absolutely loving the shots of the Death Star, The Destroyers, and all the fighters. even that movie's effects felt more ""alive"" than that of Solo and the Main Trilogy. 

Maybe, for the future, they should move back to having more matte/weathered metal feel of past series' rather than the slick, almost oily-shine looking textures they've been using as of late?

-	Reusing Extras — Probably most evident in Temporal Edict with the same alien ‘extras’ appearing both on the Cerritos and simultaneously on the crystal planet.
-	Still shots of the Cerritos — Filming a physical model was expensive and time consuming in the analog era, so ~~sometimes~~ often the production team would cheat by doing some Ken Burns zoom in on a prerendered photo of the ship in question.

Also, weird thing I’ve observed: aside from the Cerritos itself… there’s like… no CGI in the title sequence. Or at least, none that I can say “AH-HA! Spotted the CGI model”

-	Borg? 2D
-	Asteroids? 2D
-	Space Bug suckling on the nacelle? 2D with layers
-	Warbirds? 2D *and* flipped
-	Icicle? 2D

The story didn't really feel like it dragged at all and I was pretty invested the whole time, and I felt kinda silly at finally realizing the Futurama ""In-A-Gadda-Leela"" episode was a tribute to it. I honestly did not expect that to be it but it didn't feel like a twist, it felt like an honestly story driven conclusion, it was just so damn cool. Only thing I felt dragged a bit was when Scotty and Kirk were first going around the Enterprise, but I realize that was probably a pretty exciting thing for many fans to see on the big screen.

3738,"The hatred of ""technobabble"" many people on this forum have is pretty mystifying to me",1599158603,"What is derided here as ""technobabble"" (I hate that word, honestly) is what makes Star Trek what it is on a very fundamental level. If you ignore everything and purely focus on what is going on around the characters in Star Trek, you will conclude that Star Trek has far more magic than even Star Wars, a setting where space wizards run around with laser swords. Nothing in Star Wars is nowhere nearly as outrageous as things that regularly happen on Star Trek. But why is Trek not a fantasy like Star Wars even though it has far more magic? It's all a matter of MINDSET and how the writers approach the SETTING itself. Characters in Star Trek refuse to accept magic as magic. To them, magic is just yet unexplained science! That's where ""technobabble"" comes in - in a more objective narrative sense, it's what covers up the magic, but when it comes to themes, it represents the persisting claim that humanity is not at the mercy of unknowable forces, eldritch abominations, and cosmic horrors. No, we can take control of our own destiny, we can learn and figure out how the universe works, and even when a literal space god shows up, we can look him in the eye and say that all he's doing are very sophisticated tricks stemming from his knowledge of reality. There is even an entire episode of TNG where Picard and his crew do exactly that to an imposter who was pretending to be a god.

That is why for example I adore Voyager's ""technobabble"" and I adore watching Janeway and B'Elanna geeking out over a problem, because of what it represents. It represents two intelligent scientists, who also happen to be women, working very hard to get their crew out of problems by relying on the ideological core of Star Trek - a belief that science, technology and human progress can, do and will go hand in hand, until we establish and maintain a heaven for ourselves. Voyager is the exact show that should have been filled with ""technobabble"", and it's the show where I felt that ""technobabble"" was powerful and most thematically relevant.",startrek,persistentInquiry,False,/r/startrek/comments/ilzfj9/the_hatred_of_technobabble_many_people_on_this/,0
3740,"All Good Things was such a great, emotionally fitting finale for the The Next Generation...",1599158021,"Hey everyone, you may remember my [surprisingly highly-upvoted post back from when I finished The Undiscovered Country and finished the Captain Kirk era of Star Trek]( Well, I'm back with an update on my first-time viewing of all of Star Trek, and after a little over four months of binging The Next Generation, I just watched *All Good Things* last night. 

On its surface, the story is about three different generations of the U.S.S. Enterprise coming together across space and time to break down a temporal anomaly that threatens to destroy humanity. But on a deeper level, it's really a story about Picard learning the true value of the bonds and friendships he's formed with his crew over the past seven years he spent as captain, and the story was really cleverly written to reflect that message. 

The storyline with Picard being shifted to the possible future and seeing how everyone turned out...bummed me the fuck out. Deanna's dead, Will and Worf have had a falling out, Jean-Luc and Beverly are divorced, Worf is now a disgraced politician within the Klingon Empire, the Federation and the Klingons are enemies again, and Picard and Riker don't seem to be on good terms either. It was a future where everything had gone wrong and the crew went their separate ways, their friendships with each other having seemingly died out. It was a stark contrast with the present day. 

The past also served as a good contrast, with Picard realizing that in this timeframe he has not established his relationship with the crew yet, and alienating them because they all think their new captain is acting like a weirdo. It was, however, great to see how socially awkward this Data was with O'Brien's ""midnight oil"" joke, reminding us about just how far my boy has come in his quest to become more ""human"" (Not that Data still isn't a little awkward, but he's come a long way). It was really interesting to see the story unfold, with Picard in the past having to convince his new crew that their captain wasn't going mad, Picard in the present day with him and his crew at their prime, and Picard in the future trying to convince his estranged friends that he isn't going senile as a result of his illness. 

Picard seeing his crew in the past and in the future where they've all been estranged really helped him see the value of the friendships he had built with them in the present day. You can imagine my relief when the shitty possible future Picard saw turned out to be just that...a *possible* future, not one that was set in stone. Picard finally joining the rest of the crew at the poker table and having his epiphany that he ""should've done this a long time ago"" got me a little teary-eyed, and to end the series with the crew vowing that they will not allow that possible future to pass, and Picard declaring that ""the sky's the limit"" was an amazing way to end a bright-eyed, optimistic show like TNG.

**Episode 5 - ""Cupid's Errant Arrow""**

* The episode has no cold open. Other than the Short Treks, I believe this is the first episode to begin with the opening title sequence since ""Encounter at Farpoint.""
* The damaged moon of Mixtus III evokes the aftermath of Praxis, the doomed Klingon moon in *The Undiscovered Country.*
* An unstable moon was the problem of the week in ""Deja Q.""
* Boimler insists Barb is as real as ""a hopped-up Q on Captain Picard Day."" Q would have indeed been hopped up had he seen Captain Picard Day, a celebration initiated by the *Enterprise* schoolchildren in ""The Pegasus."" CPD is observed in real life by fans on multiple days each year.
* Rutherford and Tendi must deal with a plasma fire. A plasma fire - it's like a fire, but green - threatened to destroy the cargo bay in ""Disaster"" and engineering in ""Investigations.""
* The shuttles on the Vancouver (Marpole, Fairview, Kitsilani) are named after neighborhoods of that city. Vancouver is one of Trek's studio filming locations but has not been mentioned on screen before.
* Boimler enters the shuttlebay holding a teddy bear dressed like Geordi La Forge. This may be a reference to Geordi's famous success with women, completely the opposite of Boimler's struggles here.
* I don't doubt for a second that Boimler's flowers are a callback, but someone else can identify them, I have to go to work.
* Mariner suggests Boimler date the ""Phylosian in tactical."" The Phylosians were the plant people introduced in ""The Infinite Vulcan.""
* Barb recalls a mission involving ""1920s Chicago."" A planet modelling their society after this era was featured in ""A Piece of the Action.""
* Boimler describes Jet as a ""Kirk sundae with Trip Tucker sprinkles."" I don't know who Kirk was, but Charles Tucker III was the chief engineer of the NX-01 *Enterprise* and carried enough machismo to woo a Vulcan. He is alive and well and living in Tallahassee.
* Among Mariner's hypothesized identities for Barb:
 * a Romulan spy - Ambassador T'Pel turned out to be one in ""Data's Day""
 * a salt succubus - this was the creature on M113 in ""The Man Trap""
 * an android - many androids have been seen in the franchise, though perhaps the one with the biggest ""surprise factor"" was Juliana Tainer in ""Inheritance""
 * a Changeling - let's pick, oh, I dunno, Martia.
 * ""one of those sexy people in rompers who murders you for going on the grass"" - describing the Edo people of ""Justice."" Or maybe the Pakleds.
* The *Quito* appears to be an Olympic-class starship like the *Pasteur* in ""All Good Things.""
* The *Quito* is docked at what is presumably Deep Space 9, the Cardassian-designed space station guarding the Bajoran wormhole.
* The crew of the *Quito* are sporting the grey uniforms of DS9 and the TNG films, placing this flashback somewhere between 2373 and 2379.
* The gossip of the day involves Data's evil twin brother teaming up with the Borg. This is a description of the plot of ""Descent,"" where Lore finds a group of Borg ravaged by Hugh's individuality. This episode occurred in 2369 or 2370 (or both), so Mariner's friend might need to refresh her twitter feed.
* Mariner remarks that ""it's a new thing every week with those guys,"" something the *Enterprise* crew had to have noticed by that point.
* Freeman explains to the Mixtians that their ancestral homes will be moved to the sixth moon, which ""will technically be the fifth moon anyway."" A similar confusion occurred with the planets of the Ceti Alpha system in *Wrath of Khan.*
* Mariner creates a conspiracy board which contains the following items:
 * a red-eyed monstrous creature she describes as a ""dauphin,"" which is more accurately one of the forms assumed by the allasomorph in ""The Dauphin""
 * a ""surgically altered Cardassian spy,"" which is what Kira was claimed to be in ""Second Skin""
 * a ""transporter clone"" - examples include ""The Enemy Within"" and ""Second Chances""
 * a Suliban, the chameleonesque Temporal Cold War agents in ENT
 * a Romulan female, perhaps another callback to ""Data's Day"" but possibly a reference to Troi's posing as a Romulan in ""Face of the Enemy"" (or just, you know, Romulans are sneaky)
 * the featureless prototype version of Lal from ""The Offspring""
 * a pair of Bynars, the collectively-linked little dudes in ""11001001""
 * a humpback whale, which is referencing when Scotty turns out to be a whale spy in *The Voyage Home*
 * a Vendorian, already referenced in ""Envoys""
 * two Klingon females who share, um, ""features"" in common with the Duras Sisters
 * what appears to be a Sasquatch
 * a mean-looking green guy with a mohawk-like fin on his head. It is not a Xindi or an Aquan. Help.
* Part of Boimler's ""cool guy"" outfit is what looks like a Starfleet letter jacket, presumably from the Academy. Although we've never seen this before, it will hopefully be on sale soon in the CBS store.
* When Boimler spills beer on Barb he sputters ""oh, no, no, oh no"" in the same way Sonya Gomez does when she spills hot chocolate on Picard in ""Q Who.""
* Shout-out to u/T656 who *finally* [recognized]( * Mariner attempts an emergency transport, a tactic frequently used in the TNG era. Most of the time it just ""happens,"" but this is the first time someone on the other end of the line has *refused* to do it.
* She then grabs an EVA suit and jumps between ships, something done in *Nemesis,* *Into Darkness* and ""The Vulcan Hello.""
* Rather than give us Trek's first full-frontal male nudity, this episode instead gives us Trek's first visual censorship.
* The Mixtian appeals to the Prime Directive, the famous General Order One clause that prevents Starfleet from interfering in other cultures. Freeman claims it ""doesn't apply here,"" although it kinda sorta seems like it *should*...perhaps itself a reference to the shaky, malleable, impossibly complex nature of the Prime Directive.
* Barb suspects Mariner is a ""rogue holodeck character,"" evoking Moriarty, or perhaps Chaotica, or given the context, Minuet, or most likely that sneaky little shit Flotter.
* Her other guess was ""a Breen infiltrator."" The Breen were the mysterious mercenaries who ran around in refrigerated bounty hunter suits and joined up with the Dominion during the war.
* It is revealed that there are only two Mixtians on the endangered planet, reminiscent of the situation in ""The Survivors."" Freeman immediately orders the moon destroyed, in an explicit demonstration of the axiom ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few (or the two).""
* Docent's password is ""Riker,"" a reference to the fat jowly guy in ""These are the Voyages.""
* Docent bemoans having to calibrate a Dyson sphere. In the twentieth century a physicist called Freeman Dyson postulated the theory that an enormous hollow sphere could be constructed around a star. This would have the advantage of harnessing all the radiant energy of that star. A population living on the interior surface would have virtually inexhaustible sources of power. A Dyson sphere (or was it a Dyson shell) was featured in ""Relics.""
* Under the viewscreen/viewport of the orbital ship is one of those status bars with the lights that pulse inward. You know the ones.
* Boimler is infected with a neural parasite. The most famous of these were the brainwashing sluggy creatures in ""Conspiracy."" Thankfully Mariner is able to remove this parasite in a somewhat cleaner manner.",startrek,Antithesys,False,/r/startrek/comments/iltjal/canon_references_cupids_errant_arrow_spoilers/,0

Recently, when Star Trek: Lower Decks came out I realized it took place after TNG, so I can’t wait to finish TNG. Either way, I started watching Lower Decks and think it’s hilarious and awesome, was sad when I hit episode 4 and realized I had to wait for the next episode.

So... was just now watching TNG, on season 7 now, and noticed this episode was a lot like Star Trek: Lower Decks; the story was centered around the Ensigns and their point of view of being on a starship. I was thinking about making this post about how I love this episode, so I checked the name of the episode, and there at the top of my screen.... S:E15 “Lower Decks”

The main protagonists of TNG, DS9 and Voyager are the three captains - who are all north of 40 it seems. This is no surprise as it takes time to advance in military rank. Their adversaries are usually written and cast older, too. Perhaps this is, subconsciously, linked to the target audience of the shows? 

DS9 - Sisko and Dukat are both middle aged. As is Winn. The youth (Jake, Nog, Ziyal) are not as central to the story.

3772,"Can I be honest, Jonathan Archer is the worst Star Fleet Captain I have ever laid eyes on",1599119559,"So I just finished Cogenitor which is Season 2 episode 22 of Star Trek Enterprise and if I’m being honest I’m hesitant to continue watching this so called “captain” make terrible decision after terrible decision. I’ve thought some of his choices were questionable in the past but this, this was the dumbest shit ever. So for those of you who don’t know, the starship Enterprise encounters the Vissians who have a third gender that is basically a surrogate for the child. This surrogate is basically a slave who after having a child for one couple is given to another, and so on. Trip decided to take it upon himself to teach the Vissian how to read and show her some movies. Eventually he brings her over to the Enterprise and he convinces her to request political asylum. Captain Archer (who got this job because of nepotism apparently) was on a three day survey by himself with an alien he just met which isn’t that bad but once he gets back and finds out the situation with Trip he goes bananas. He argues with the Vissian captain and engineer about how they describe their Cogenitor as an object and that asylum must be taken very seriously, I would understand if they had threatened the ship and he was forced to return the surrogate but he does it solely to keep good relations. Another thing is when Trip says he tried to help free a slave because he thought “its what the captain would’ve done” the captain lays into him about how he must be setting a bad example if he thinks that freeing a slave is the right thing to do? He then says it was the right thing if they were in Singapore or Florida but not out in space. Even though that’s exactly what he did when they encountered a Suliban prison camp and talked of the Japanese-Americans being in prison during WW2. After they get the message that the Cogenitor committed suicide Archer is like that’s one more person who would’ve been alive if we didn’t make first contact, like that’s all you have to say, if I was Trip I would’ve asked for permission to speak freely then asked the captain if only he is allowed to selectively enforce human morals when they’re away from earth. He tells trip that her blood is on his hands because he taught her how to read and she realized how terrible her existence was and decided to end it, the parallels to slaves during the American 1700, and 1800s is obvious. In my opinion the blood was on captain Archers hands not on Trips, he bemoans that the couple will now have to wait “a long while” before they can get a new slave for them to breed with. “Maybe this will teach you a lesson” what lesson is that, that if I teach a subjugated part of an alien population basic reading skills she will comprehend how awful her existence is and commit suicide and no longer breed for her masters? Maybe there’s an argument to be made that we can teach them some of our values through interacting with them but they never make it and this society is already far more advanced than we are, but they never make it. There are some other extremely questionable choices he has made, like in episode 8 of season 2 when Malcolm lost his communicator on a pre warp planet. Instead of cutting his losses and letting them think the device is some technology that belongs to a rival faction they go down there to retrieve it and get kidnapped and lose a bunch of their phasers and shit, then these poor aliens see their captors just inside of what appears to be an invisible ship to escape, doing far more damage than just one device could’ve. He also yelled at Trip for getting impregnated by an alien when it was not his fault at all they just held hands in some sand. His racism towards the Vulcans is a bit much, to the point where he would rather endanger the lives of his crew than say ask them to use their tractor beam. His decision to bring Porthos(his dog) aboard was questionable at best. When the dog is sick it causes him to act irrationally and be rude to visiting aliens, but he reprimands Trip about respecting first contact which he just ignored. He lets his crew go camping on a planet with pollen that drives them insane, he doesn’t even send a team down to investigate before letting everyone go camping. To be honest this show has a lot of issues, like Caleb’s god awful acting, the unnecessary scenes in the decomp chamber, the theme song (which is starting to grow on me), and the constant retcons it does, they ran into the Ferengi apparently way before Picard did. after typing this post the episode is over and now the next one is starting and it’s about the Borg frozen in the Ice and it turns out that not only had Starfleet already encountered the borg, the starship Enterprise’s medic developed a cure for the borg nanoprobes they inject into people to assimilate them. This makes a lot of the borg plot in TNG pointless. Than in episode 25 T’Pol tells captain the Tellerite are dangerous and his only remark is to mention it to Trip before theyre shot. We also get another decomp chamber scene with T’Pol which is essential to the plot I’m sure. Overall this show is just so disappointing I’m not sure who thought this prequel was a good idea but they deserve to be shots I think this ranks firmly in last place for all Star Trek shows, live action, animated, and fan made. Out of all of them this one is by far the worst. By the time I finished typing this captain archer was kidnapped by a bounty hunter like the goddamn moron he is. Poor T’Pol, having to be second in command to him and here he tries to plead to the bounty hunters emotions by telling them he was helping a ship of refugees, even though it was in violation of Klingon law. Violating alien law for human morals is what he yelled at Trip for but only two episodes later he’s using it as a defense to an alien bounty hunter, probably without realizing his hypocrisy at all.",startrek,johnstark2,False,/r/startrek/comments/ilp8ay/can_i_be_honest_jonathan_archer_is_the_worst_star/,0

I remember being annoyed by the technobabble in Voyager back when it aired. Too many plot solutions hinged on characters spouting gobbeltygook. I'm going to stick with my rewatch, but I gotta say, after going through TNG and DS9 recently, Voyager's casual abuse and overuse of technobabble is far worse than I remembered.

3774,TNG: Relics,1599117598,"I recently watched Relics for the first time in a while. Although it is definitely a good episode, I noticed a few things that were rather out of character:

Geordi is generally a great people person (if you ignore his creepy attempts at romance). He generally makes everyone feel welcome. Data considered him his first true friend. Yet Geordi is downright rude to Scotty. I realize that Scotty was getting in the way, but still, I think Geordi would have been more diplomatic.

Is Scotty a living legend? I don't know, but from his treatment in this episode, I'd say not. The crew rarely makes references to the TOS crew, which is perfectly reasonable - I don't spend much time talking about people from 80 years ago. But when the names Kirk or Spock are mentioned, it's clear everyone in Starfleet knows those names. I understand that Scotty is probably a lot less famous, but he must be an important historical figure for an engineer, right? It just seemed weird that Picard is the only person to express a genuine interest in getting to know Scotty.

I realize the Dyson Sphere was just the B plot, but it still seemed rather unexplored. The plot basically went from: Wow - a Dyson Sphere! - Shit, now we're trapped and have to get out. - Ok, now we're out. Time for another adventure. I just would have expected a little more interest in trying to learn about who created it, and where they went, etc.

The final sendoff was a nice scene, but when you think about it bizarre. Here's an old man, feeling lonely and useless, and what do they do? They give him a tiny spaceship with limited range be alone in. I get it - they had to send him off into the wild blue yonder, in search of new adventure, but doing that alone in a shuttlecraft just seems weird.

While a joined host will have memories from their previous hosts, that does not make them trans. Trill hosts are always their own person and there are multiple episodes where it is established that Trill are not their previous hosts. To our knowledge, the symbiote may or may not have gender.

__Soren and the J'naii__

The J'naii identify as androgenous or agender. This is not necessarily the same as being non-binary (nb) though someone who identifies as nb may also identify as agender. An incredibly simplified explanation is that on the spectrum of Male to Female, people who are nb will often say they exist somewhere in the middle of the two whereas someone who is agender will often say they are off the spectrum entirely.

Soren identified as woman until she was put through conversion therapy, brainwashed, and possibly mutilated. She was not agender until she was forced to be.

As a kid I grew up with Voyager, The Next Generation and DS9 and have fond memories of those. Voyager is my favorite of all series btw. I've also seen most of the other series/movies but never seen Enterprise. I really wasn't very eager to start with Enterprise and when I did decide to try it, I almost abandoned ship and pretty much hated almost the entire crew. Malcom, Archer, Trip, T-pol etc. I just didn't find the characters and the actors appealing. Enterprise is supposedly the worst series but as I watched more and more of it, I started to enjoy it more and more and really grew on the crew. In fact, now that I've finished it, I feel like it was a fine crew and the actors did a pretty good job. Also, it's amazing how the Star Trek writers seem to be able to give the doctors on the different series such an unique and appealing personality. &gt;!It was pretty weird in the first part of the series to not have photon torpedo's (I didn't knew it was a prequel at first) but even cooler later when they were equipped with them (still no shields though :P ).!&lt; 

I got to admit, now that I've finished the series, I feel a bit empty and really miss the crew and their adventures (just as with some other reruns I did :P ). It was pretty disappointing to have Enterprise finish so abruptly :( One thing that surprised me a bit though is that at one point in the series !&gt;they had to make the impossible decision to either give up an important, live saving mission or pillage some warp parts from an alien freighter in distress and they eventually went through with stealing the parts leaving the freighter with only impulse engines. I was expecting the series to either have a reference in a later episode in where they sent another Starfleet vessel to the alien freighter to make things right or something, or go out for them themselves but that never happened!&lt;.

We instead have to accept that the tech of TOS is actually more advanced and just has a different aesthetic than discovery. The TOS era ships still look the same. The discovery era ships still look the same. Ships undergo refits. In Star Trek, each decade in universe has a different aesthetic. Of course Discovery ships are going to look different than TOS ones. In fact, the Shenzhou is a 2240s ship and it has its own aesthetic because it is from the 2240s and not the 2250s. It’s the previous decade which would naturally have its own aesthetic, so the decade before TOS would also not have the same aesthetic as TOS. Think of how different the ships in TMP-2270s (and a few old ships from the 2270s that weren’t refit for some reason later movies) looked from TOS ships. It’s a new aesthetic. Also the USS Discovery is an experimental ship, so it’s has its own aesthetic which is somewhat different from most Starfleet ships at the time, which likely look more like the discovery enterprise internally. Also the only tech differences I can think of are the lack of holographic communications, holographic controls, and touchscreens. Perhaps starfleet decided to give up touchscreens and holographic controls because buttons are harder for AIs such as Control to hack. Star Trek ships change appearance drastically after being refit.

3830,Project Defiant: DS9 1080p+ Upscale Now Available,1599055185,"TLDR: DS9 upscale is here. Skip all the way to the bottom for instructions on where to get it. We've opted to release it in 1080p+, where it's first upscaled to 4K and then compressed to 1080p in x265. Thanks for all of your feedback!

&amp;#x200B;

Mods, please let me know if you feel this is inappropriate for the sub.

&amp;#x200B;

Seasons 3-7 are ready and looking great! We listened to your feedback from our previous work and opted to release these seasons in 1080p+, minimizing the file size while maintaining  a visual quality comparable to the raw 4K files.

&amp;#x200B;

A few key differences when compared to our Seasons 1 &amp; 2 releases:

* 1080p+ x265 MKV instead of 4K or 1080p MP4 file container. For this process we first upscale to 4K and then compress to 1080p in x265, which results in a nearly indistinguishable visual quality when compared to the raw 4K.
*  Better overall upscaling results (as we said in the seasons 1 &amp; 2 posts, the earlier seasons don't take to the upscale as well as the latter ones do)
*  We re-added the subtitles! Our release is now in MKV format for this purpose.
*  We've been seeding the file for a while before making the announcement, so downloads should be faster
* Most seasons are now in the original stereo audio.

&amp;#x200B;

Project Details:

&amp;#x200B;

Lately there has been a lot of talk about upscaling DS9. There are many people working all over the globe to accomplish this, each trying their own methods and sources.

Much like its namesake, Project Defiant is the imperfect, but sturdy, approach to the problem. We have directly upscaled all of DS9 from MKV source files. The result isn't as perfect as some of the other approaches, but it's quick and available en-masse.

Don't expect the quality to be equal to that of a native remaster, but it's a huge step up from the originals. Also, audio synchronization is sometimes imperfect; this is due to the fact that the original source has a variable framerate that was common in 90's TV shows and had to be converted to constant framerate (CFR) prior to the upscaling.

We sampled episodes from each season, and noticed that seasons 1 &amp; 2 don't play as nicely with the upscale as the latter seasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Technical details:

We're using Topaz Labs' Gigapixel AI for video (currently available for free in Beta). This upscales the video without cropping, which makes everything take longer, but at least no information is lost. We now post-process every episode in H265 using HandBrake to minimize the file size and maintain aspect-ratio. Each episode is between 500 Mb and 1 GB. The difference in file size between some episodes is due to the processing time dedicated to compressing the file in H265.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to upscale something yourself:

We've created an upscale guide ([found here]( &amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How to get it:

This is the tricky part. DS9 is the property of CBS, and we want you to show them how much you love it; so please buy the DVDs from a retailer before proceeding, only then will they consider doing a full remaster. You should never download any media that you don't already own. Furthermore, downloading anything from the internet can pose a great risk to you and should never be done without a VPN and antivirus. With that being said, the upscale is available on a specific public torrent site. I won't mention which one publicly, as I don't wish to break any rules here. It is possible to find it on Google by searching ""Star Trek Deep Space 9 S## AI Upscale 1080p+ (2020)"" (quotation marks included, but replace ## with the season number. ie S07).

Project Defiant Upscale Guide v1.5

\- Jay216

&amp;#x200B;

This guide is a work in progress. All feedback is welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

Software requirements:

	Gigapixel AI for Video (Beta)

		[ 	Handbrake

		[ &amp;#x200B;

Hardware requirements:

	GPU:	GTX 1080 or better (must be Nvidia)

	CPU:	Ryzen 3 / Intel i3 or better

	RAM:	8 GB or more

	

\------------------------------------------------------------------

\---------------------Constant Framerate Guide---------------------

\------------------------------------------------------------------

	1- Start with whichever episode you wish you convert in MKV

		format.

&amp;#x200B;

	2. In Handbrake, go to ""Tools"" &gt; ""Preferences"" &gt; ""Output Files"".

		Near the bottom, next to ""MP4 File Extension"", 

		Select ""Always use MP4""

&amp;#x200B;

	3- Drag and drop the video you wish to convert into Handbrake

	

	4- Select the following settings:

		Preset: HQ 480p30 Surround

		

		Summary tab:

			format:			mp4

			Check ""Align A/V Start""

			

		Video tab:

			Video Codec: 		H.264(x264)

			Framerate (FPS):	30

			Check ""Constant Framerate""

			Encoder Preset:		Slower (third from right)

		

		Audio tab:

			Mixdown:	5.1 Channels

			Bitrate:	448

			

		Save as:	""DS9 s00e00 TITLE- CFR.mp4""

			Replacing the 00 with the correct season and episode

			number, and TITLE with the correct episode name.

	

	5- Click on the green ""Start Encode"" button at the top.

	

	The processing time per episode will be	\~30 min, and will

	use as much of your CPU as possible. This slows down the

	computer significantly. So only do this when the computer

	won't be used. You can also choose to do many of these

	conversions together overnight.

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------------------------

\--------------------------Upscale Guide---------------------------

\------------------------------------------------------------------

	1- Install Gigapixel AI for Video from this link: 

		[ 		

	2- Open a command window:

		2.a Press  Windows\_Key + R

		2.b type ""cmd"" (no quotes) and press OK

		2.c ALTERNATE: In the Windows search bar, type ""CMD""

			and open the ""Command Prompt""

	

	3- Type the following code (choose one depending on resolution):

			A. For 1080p upscale

videosrcmd.exe ""inputVideoPath"" -w 1584 -h 1080

			B. For 4K upscale

videosrcmd.exe ""inputVideoPath"" -w 3168 -h 2160



		Here, inputVideoPath will be the location of the video you

		wish to upscale. For example:

			videosrcmd.exe ""C:\\Users\\Me\\Desktop\\DS9 s06e06 Sacrifice of Angels- CFR.mp4"" -w 3168 -h 2160

		

		Documentation for this code can be found here:

			[ 		

		Note that for Star Trek DS9, the width will always have the

		following formula:

			Width = Height x (4.4 / 3)

	

	The process will take \~8 hours for 1080p and \~19 hours for

	4K, depending on your GPU. This will not generally slow down 

	the computer, so you may continue to use it for anything that's

	not GPU-intensive.

	

	The output video file name should be of the format:

		DS9 s00e00 TITLE- CFR\_x2.22.mp4

	where x2.22 is the upscale factor and may be different.

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------------------------

\----------------1080p H.265 Post-processing Guide-----------------

\------------------------------------------------------------------

	In our case, post processing with H.265 allows us to minimize 

	the file size without losing any quality whatsoever.

	

	1- Drag and drop the upscaled video you wish to process into

		Handbrake.

	

	2- Select the following settings:

		Preset: HQ 1080p30 Surround

		

		Summary tab:

			format:			mp4

			Check ""Align A/V Start""

		

		Dimensions tab:

			Anamorphic: Custom

			Uncheck ""Keep Aspect Ratio"" (next to 'Height' box)

			Width: 	1584

			Height:	1080

			(Don't touch ""Display Width"")

			PAR:	10	x	11

or

3	x	4

\*Display Width should automatically adjust to 

1440. Choose the PAR that yields this result.

\*\*Under ""Output"" (beneath PAR), the text should

read:

""Display Size: 1440x1080, PAR 10x11""

or

""Display Size: 1440x1080, PAR 3x4""

depending on the selected PAR. In either case,

the size should be 1440x1080.

		

		Video tab:

			Video Codec: 		H.265(x265)

			Framerate (FPS):	30

			Encoder Preset:		Fast

		

		Audio tab:

			Mixdown:	5.1 Channels

			Bitrate:	448

			

		Save as:	""DS9 s00e00 TITLE- CFR\_x2.22- H265.mp4""

			Replacing the 00 with the correct season and episode

			number, TITLE with the correct episode name, and 2.22

			with the correct upscale factor.

	

	3- Click on the green ""Start Encode"" button at the top.

Sisko’s *In The Pale Moonlight* Ending Monologue

Original:

“At 08:00 hours station time, the Romulan Empire formally declared war against the Dominion. They have already struck 15 bases along the Cardassian border. So, this is a huge victory for the good guys! This may even be the turning point of the entire war! There is even a welcome to the fight party tonight in the wardroom. So… I lied, I cheated, I bribed men to cover the crimes of other men. I am an accessory to murder. But the most damning thing of all… I think I can live with it, and if I had to do it all over again, I would. Garak was right about one thing: a guilty conscience is a small price to pay for the safety of the Alpha Quadrant, so I will learn to live with it. Because I can live with it. I can live with it. Computer, erase that entire personal log.”

Translation:

“太空站时间，早上八点，罗慕兰帝国向自治同盟正式宣战。他们已经攻击了十五个在卡达西呀边境的基地。所以这是好人的重大胜利！这可能是整个战争的转折点！今晚在军官室甚至有“欢迎参战”的派对。所以… 我撒了谎，我骗了，我收买了人掩盖别人的罪行。我是谋杀案的帮凶。但最该死的一件事… 我觉得自己可以应付一切，而且如果需要再一次做，我就会做。加啦克(Garak)对一件事是正确的：问心有愧至于第一象限的安全真是小小的价格，所以我会习惯应付一切。因为我能应付一切。我能应付。电脑，消除全部的私人日志。”

Picard’s speech to Wesley about truth

Original:

“You even sat in my chair. I was annoyed. Presumptuous child playing on my ship. But I never forgot how you already knew every control, every display. You behaved as though you belonged on the Bridge.

And then later when I decided to make you an acting ensign, I was convinced you could be an outstanding officer. I’ve never questioned that conviction, until now.

The first duty of every Starfleet officer is to the truth. Whether it’s scientific truth, or historical truth, or personal truth. It is the guiding principle upon which Starfleet is based. If you can’t find it within yourself to stand up and tell the truth about what happened you don’t deserve to wear that uniform.

I’m going to make this simple for you, Mr. Crusher. Either you come forward and tell Admiral Brand what really took place, or I will.”

Translation:

“你甚至在我的椅子上坐了。我烦了。非分的孩子玩儿在我的星船。但我从来没忘记你已经知道每个的电钮、每台显示屏。你的举止好想你属于舰桥。

然后，当我决定让你成为代理少尉时，我相信你可以成为一名优秀的军官。到现在我从来没怀疑那个信仰。

每名星际舰队军官的主要职责是维护真里。无论是科学真理、历史真理、还是个人真理。真理是星际舰队所依据的指导原则。如果你不可以起来，说出真相，你就不值得穿那套制服。

What's up with the marketing??,1599012402,"I know, I know, the pandemic has turned everything upside down, but the lack of Discovery marketing is just **so** bizarre to me! I don't understand what the thinking is at all? We've gotten a one minute teaser trailer, which was literally almost 11 months ago now...and that's it. We haven't gotten anything else since, no new images, no cast interviews, no new casting info, **nothing**.  I mean think about it, they have been introduced to one new cast member, David Ajala, and that's literally been it. Since the show now takes place in an entire new century I expect tons of new characters/actors this season and yet not a word on any of them yet. 

But I was sure we were getting a big new trailer by the time Lower Decks premiered, when people were paying attention again. I don't get why there is so much secrecy?? I know this isn't the old days but believe it or not Star Trek wasn't this cloaked in  every season. In fact in the TNG days the producers and writers would tell us entire episodes and plot lines we would see before the season started. Now, it's like you can't even mention the names of the episode titles because that might give too much away. I think the mystery box thing is really getting out of hand these days, especially since all the secrets they keep hasn't really done them a lot of good from Khan to Voq, but I digress.

Anyway, its just odd. It premieres in 6 weeks now and you would think the marketing would be in full gear now? Especially since its been off more than a year. With the other seasons and Picard, we knew quite a bit about those seasons and we had the final trailer aired before 2 months.

 So I imagined how a disgruntled Lt. Daniels would tell his story on Lower Decks.

—

“So there I am at tactical, still a bit in shock. *I* fired the quantum torpedoes that killed a Borg cube. That’s definitely going on my resume.

But then this *other* little ball-shaped bugger shoots out from it. Captain Picard orders a pursuit course. Seconds away from Earth. The whole Federation hangs in the balance. I get the firing solution locked in. And then...I stood down and got relieved.”

“What!? I thought you said the Borg were practically on top of Earth! And you were so close another ship got caught in the explosion. Surely Captain Picard immediately ordered you to shoot it down.”

“No, he was too busy talking with Worf.”

“Worf!? The guy who killed Gowron *and* Duras? Wasn’t he at Deep Space Nine? What was he doing on the Enterprise?”

“I dunno, he just showed up. Picard and Riker asked him if he still remembered how to use the tactical console and then shooed me aside.”

“Did he!?”

“I mean, he never trained on the Sovereign. By the time he figured out how to target the ball, it had opened a time portal and turned the whole planet into a Borg colony.”

“You can’t be serious!”

“We lost four hundred people over the next two days.”

“Oh my god.”

—

“We spent almost an hour trying to clear the debris from the med bay where we heard the shouting. Lost two good men to roving Borg attacks. Finally we got the door open. Suddenly I have an EMH in my face shouting something to me about this being a completely inappropriate use of his program and if we could please shut him off before we left.”

“Yeah, I, uh, never had that problem before. Seriously. ^Please ^don’t ^look ^at ^the ^logs.”

—

“We came across holodeck two on our way back to the bridge. The music coming through the half-open door is what made us notice it. It was a complete bloodbath inside. Someone had left the program running with the safeties off. There was a pile of Borg bodies around the door. Some kind of period story running with gangsters and machine guns in a club. We hadn’t taken two steps when all of a sudden they started shooting at us from behind a makeshift blockade of tables. Lost another good man then.

We tried to shoot back, but there were just too many of them. We retreated when we heard more Borg coming. Hid for a bit and watched them march into the holodeck. It was the most surreal thing I’ve ever seen. Like some kind of cult thing. They had to know it was suicide. But they couldn’t give up. Not without admitting resistance wasn’t futile, and resistance from a bunch of holographic gangsters no less.”

—

“We were sprinting through the auxiliary loading room when all of a sudden, Sam, my best man, trips. But some godforsaken idiot had left the space door open. He goes flying through the forcefield and straight into orbit. Nothing we could do. You know the first thing they teach you at the Academy?”

“To tell the truth?”

“No. Put your f***ing tools away and leave the work area like you found it. I swear if I ever find out who left that goddamn door open, I’ll petition Admiral Picard myself to have him kicked out of the service.”

—

“...but of course nobody bothered to tell *me* we were evacuating. There I was, trapped in a Jeffries tube with a bunch of Borg drones. My men dead, all the escape pods gone. I was a goner for sure. I started to put my phaser on overload. Then, suddenly all the Borg all dropped to the floor. I grabbed a tricorder...all dead.”

“What!? No way. How does that happen?”

“Well, I wasn’t there, but scuttlebutt is that Commander Data...did *something*...to the Borg. *(hand gesture)*”

“Are...are you saying the Enterprise’s second officer f***ed the Borg to death!?”

“I mean...he didn’t out and out say it, but a couple days later someone jokingly asked him if he was looking forward to R&amp;R, and how long it’d been since he’d gotten some ‘downtime’. All he said was ‘If you are referring to sexual activity, then 2 days, 6 hours, and 34 minutes’. Conversation came to a dead stop. That’s within ten minutes of when I saw those Borg drones drop.”

They had engineering locked down *really* tight too. Called it a ‘coolant leak’. Yeah, right. When that happened on the Enterprise D, the whole stardrive blew up. Warp coolant can’t melt Borg exoskeletons, either. It was clearly a coverup.”

Like Space Seed has all of the low budget 60's cheese, no more than most other episodes, and I think for me at least that episode works so well becuase the writing is so good in spite of the very dated presentation, including the dilog, which while still of that era but it also feels, idk, more mature I guess. This is just my opinion but I feel if more episodes were done as well as episodes like that the dated cheese and low budget wouldn't be nearly as much of a problem to modern audiences. Personally there's only a few episodes of TOS I really like, and I realize it's the becuase I don't think the writing was all that good for most of them City on the Edge of Forever I think is the only episode that really has none of these problems.

Here's why,1598979856,"Sorry for the long post but please believe me that I couldn't make this any shorter without sacrficing essential details. I made it as short as I possibly could to the best of my abilities.

I'm a life long Star Trek fan. Yet it was only this year that I watched DS9 for the first time. However, I was already fascinated by the Cardassians in TNG, specifically from the two-part Chains of Command. However, I am from and live in a country where I can get to appreciate the Cardassians far more than any Trekkie in a developed, western democracy.

They are the most fleshed out race and civilisation in all of Trek. Far more than the Klingons, the Romulans, the Vulcans, the Changelings, the Borg, the Ferengi. You get my point.

Why do I say so? Because each of these races were intended to be one-dimensional extremes or manifestations of one or two human characteristics. The Klingons are grunting machos. The Romulans are cunning fiends. The Vulcans are rational objective thinkers. The Changelings are the bullied who became bullies. The Borg are all-conquering Mongols. The Ferengi are capitalists. I know that I must have missed some nuances but these descriptions are the gist of it and are what is intended by the writers. Each race is meant for the audiences to look at one or two aspects of their humanity vividly.

It is not so easy to put the Cardassians into such a box. There were so complex and multi-faceted. The episodes where this really becomes exemplified are S1 E18 ""Duet"", S2 E5 ""Cardassians"", S2 E18 ""Profit and Loss"", and S3 E5 ""Second Skin."" In these episodes you really get to see the very complex political and social situation on Cardassia. They aren't a monolithic people represented by the state. They have dissidents. They have anti-government activitists. They have people who want revolution. They have high ranking military officers who want regime change. In these episodes and over the course of DS9, Cardassians were shown to be as diverse and difficult to fully describe as humans are.

""Second Skin"" really hit me emotionally. Ghemor is no different than any human parent who wishes to be reunited with their long lost child. The drama of his character and the interplay between him and Kira was not alien or unrelatable at all. These episodes were especially heartbreaking because they were a big reminder of the tragedy my own country is.

This brings me to how Cardassia is especially fascinating and difficult for someone like me to watch. I've seen many of you comparing the Cardassian Union to fascist Italy or the Third Reich. I would disagree because Cardassia is typical of a third-world military dictatorship on present-day Earth. There were military dictatorships in the recent past just like them in South America and there are ones today in Africa, the Arab world, and Asia whose politics and internal security practices are exactly like the Cardassian Union.

These dicatorships are poor, mid-level regional powers with bloated military budgets spent at the expense of their people. I am not revealing my country or my continent because my own country has an internal security and intelligence agencies just like the Obsidian Order. They can hear and see and know everything and make people disappear exclusively for something you post on the internet. They are also very powerful and have much more influence and control over government than our ""elected"" parliament. Their agents could be the guy who is selling you fruit and vegetables on the street corner, or even a plain simple tailor who speaks in half truths and in a very devious opaque manner.

The torture scene in Chains of Command is just too real. The way our own dissidents and suspected terrorists are treated in our own secret facilities is exactly the same. The interrogator is usually a well and softly spoken man who tries to befriend you while doing monstrous things to you simultaneously. My skin crawled watching that episode and remembering testimonials from our torture victims.

Lastly, the Cardassian justice system was not something the writers creatively came up with. It was merely a literal and explicit depiction of how the justice systems in these petty military dictatorships actually work. If you are arrested for political reasons, the authorities have already decided what's going to happen to you. It might as well be as explicit as it is on Cardassia. The trial is just for show, to show the people how victorious the state is over its enemies and send a warning to anyone who dares to even think a single thought of dissent.

I hope you found my essay and interesting and I hope you've learned something new. And I hope that you will appreciate the Cardassians even more and perhaps in a whole new way. This is why they are my favourite race.",startrek,Queue2020,False,/r/startrek/comments/iko7pg/essay_cardassians_are_star_treks_most_fascinating/,0
3887,"Fan theory on Romulans, Vulcan, The Admonition, and a few special guest stars...",1598979344,"It's accepted fact that Vulcans and Romulans are a divergent species. It's lesser known that there is a throw away line in TOS where Spock speculates that Vulcans are not indigenous to Vulcan but are decendants of the Arretan's due to similarities in Vulcan myth to their story. But the destruction of the Arretans was about 400,000 years ago.

We do not know who exactly built the Admonition, but we know it's about 200,000 to 300,000 years old, and built by artificial life. A period after the destruction of the Arretan civilization. We also know the Iconians were an ancient and powerful civilization that was destroyed by bombardment from space about 200,000 years ago by an unknown force.

The Vulcans, Romulans, and other ""Proto-Vulcan"" species  are the former Iconians, who were the Arretan's.  

For millenia this species has risen to greatness through hubris and technological mastery, only to be destroyed by their own hands or by their AI slaves. Some time in the past, Vulcan faced another similar situation where they were nearly wiped out. Surak, recognizing the arrogance of their race has led to repeated near-extinction, created logic and the desire to purge emotion as a way to save their race and end the cycle. The Romulans refused and set off to find their own way, choosing to forever shun AI instead of embracing logic as a way to break the cycle.

Thus, the struggle to achieve humility through logic and avoiding exploration and scientific discover for centuries by the Vulcans was a solution. The Romulans desire to destroy all AI which has slowed their technology to a crawl is the other. Both are a desire to avoid the cycle of violence and playing God through technology.",startrek,eternalkerri,False,/r/startrek/comments/iko1bj/fan_theory_on_romulans_vulcan_the_admonition_and/,0

3891,Does each alternative reality has its own Q?,1598975506,"Lately I’ve been wondering if there’s one Q on each Star Trek timeline or if he’s the same on each of them. I really want to believe in the former but right now I think the first is more likely 

On Tapestry (TNG S06EP15) Q sends Picard to his past. The result is that the future was changed. Was it? We don’t know if by not fighting with the Nausicaans the Picard we know was sent to another timeline or if our reality was altered. But that’s, as far as I know the closest thing we’ve seen from Q traveling through alternative realities (though I bet he can visit if them he wants to). 

Laterly, on Parallels (S07EP11), we see thousands of Enterprises in one of the realities. In one of them, the Federation was defeated by the Borg. However we do know that Q was the one who introduced the Borg to the Picard and the Federation (S02EP16). And why did he do this? He wanted to make a point. Simple as that. And he did it. Picard admitted that Q was right. 

It is possible, of course (in fact very likely) that in one of the alternative universes the Federation and the Borg had a different encounter. But that’s probably the very exception considering how distant from the Federation the Borg are and especially the many other alternative timelines we’ve seen that don’t suggest anything like this. 

So, unless we are facing a very unlikely coincidence or Q wants to make this very same point again (and again, considering that in one of the realities Worf was transported on Parallels Picard was killed fighting the Borg) each reality has its own Q.

I always found Q’s might somehow overrated. They’re probably the most powerful species in Star Trek Universe, though a few others might be on the same level, like the Organians, Dowd or the Trelane species, but if I’m right I guess they kinda hit the rockbottom to me. Not only they are unique, but they are also far from being special considering how common they are in the multiverse. 

So, what do you think?",startrek,BrightShadow168,False,/r/startrek/comments/ikmsjw/does_each_alternative_reality_has_its_own_q/,0

3894,Looking for a Star Trek viewing buddy,1598973016,"I have embarked on the rather massive undertaking of watching the entirety of the ST franchise, and I'm looking for someone who is interested in watching along and potentially having a regular (weekly?) phone/skype/what-have-you discussions on topics related to what we are watching. If you are interested in something like that, please send me a DM.

&amp;#x200B;

I am in the US Mountain Standard Time zone (GMT -7), but I don't have a preference for where this buddy lives, provided we can work out an amenable schedule for our regular discussions.

&amp;#x200B;

I have started out of production order with TNG, but I am only about halfway into S1, so I'm open to starting from TOS (which I haven't seen at all) and then picking up where I left off with TNG. Right now, I'm considering watching TOS/TNG in parallel as I'm finding TNG is not particularly well-suited to binge watching (which is not a surprise, given its strictly episodic structure).

&amp;#x200B;

Right now,  I'm watching (roughly) at a rate of 2 episodes per day during the week (not much on weekends). I'm not sure if I can keep that tempo up for the duration of nearly 800 episodes + movies, but I am certainly going to try. 

&amp;#x200B;

My ST knowledge is fairly limited to TNG-era canon, and most of that is fuzzy because the last time I watched an episode was sometime in the mid-90s. I have seen all of the pre-reboot movies, but many of them so long ago that I might as well have not seen them at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from the in-universe discussions that I hope to have, I'm also hoping to pick at various themes, underlying premises, how things have held up over the years (scientifically, thematically, culturally, etc.), evolution of characters, races, meta-discussions on premises, and on and on.

3937,The Pakleds...a missed opportunity?,1598910288,"Please bear with me, haha.

I realize they are generally the worst written aliens of the week and that unlike the Ferengi on DS9, there really is no redeeming the Pakleds.  I'm offering this as a slight modification to their characterization in hopes that they might be viewed as a missed chance to really challenge the ethos of the 24th Century Federation.

The setup for this species is actually fine.  They disarm with their poor diction and seeming hapless ineptitude and then they suddenly strike like kidnappers/terrorists.  The problem is that they continue to be imbecilic throughout the kidnapping of Geordi and we see that the low IQ act was not really an act.  They are bastards, but they are also easily fooled morons.  The solution to kidnapping Geordi is rather poorly written but it seems that any number of ways to out think the Pakleds would have sufficed.

What if instead they were written as a race of sociopaths?

It could have been a very interesting episode if they peeled off their fake up-swept eyebrows (Thomas Riker style) and suddenly switched to flawless diction.  If they used theatrics but were ruthless and calculating AND clearly intelligent, and if we as the viewers were as taken in by their falsely dumpy appearance as the crew was, there'd be more payoff.  (This is more plausible if Troi cannot sense their deception and it might allow for Worf to have finally, independently, to be right about SOMETHING.)

What could have been fascinating is the crew discussing them as a race that somehow did not go extinct while sociopathy became a dominant genetic trait among their people.  Troi may not have sensed mal-intent because there was no real emotion behind their actions to be sensed.  They were simply finding the most direct route to attain their goals and torturing Geordi with a phaser was that most direct route.  If diplomacy had presented as a better option, they may well have gone in that direction.  But a species that truly does not have any sense of right or wrong, and no better nature to appeal to, no concept of why you SHOULDN'T torture an alien just to get their tech...that's actually interesting.  It's particularly interesting in the era of ""we've found that honor is a commonality with the Klingons and so they are not so different after all.""  Or later in The Enemy, ""We've found that Romulans actually care for their crew-mates as much as we do, we have commonalities that could form a basis for understanding.""  I would just love to see the highly principled 24th Century diplomats coming face to face with a species that they fundamentally cannot relate to.  That no high minded speech from anyone on the Enterprise could possibly persuade the Pakleds.  And even if we do get out of this situation with them, what could a truly amoral species resort to next?  Could diplomatic relations ever be sustained?   Should they even be allowed to travel through space if they are just a likely to predate on others as to openly trade with them?  Would a technological advantage even mean much against such an unpredictable foe with a total lack of morality?  And what if they continue leaping up the tech ladder?  Could that even be allowed?

I think some of my favorite TNG episodes presents these types of moral dilemmas or interesting questions.  The bulk of the episode revolving around a simple debate about what is to be done now that a race of sociopaths is loose in the galaxy could be fascinating.  Instead, they are just mean dopes who have not ""developed"" enough.  They trick the crew so the crew lamely tricks them back.  Just a missed chance to make something a bit more interesting, I feel.   A kind of anti-Federation in that they have no real tech power...they have no real diplomatic skills...and no unity with other species...but even without these attributes they somehow find cold and calculating ways to empower themselves by thinking of ruthless or amoral approaches the crew struggles to even imagine.

If this approach had been taken with the Pakleds, I'd have welcomed return visits by the species, if just to see the unique types of dilemmas they'd create for the crew and the havoc they might bring to the quadrant.

3959,Thoughts On Voyager,1598878852,"Just finished rewatching Voyager, and I found quite a lot of positives from what a lot of other people consider negatives of the show.

Mostly, what I love about Voyager is that it is as close to TOS as any Berman-era Trek. It focusses more on plot and missions than on individual character stories. We never got McCoy episodes or Scotty episodes back in TOS. The focus was on the crew working together, and it's one of Voyager's strengths. I loved the focus on character stories in DS9, but I was ready for more of the kind of crew-focus we see on TOS by the end.

As a result, one of the biggest criticisms of Voyager is the lack of character development: I agree that quite a few characters are never fleshed out properly (Harry Kim deserves the biggest mention here), and don't get much individual screen time. But, as a positive spin, it gave me more of a scope to make up my own back story or history for them. 

My only real issue with Voyager is that the ending felt a bit rushed. Admittedly, I'm glad that Voyager is the last place we see the crew before they fly off towards Earth. It's the place we got to know them and care about them over 7 seasons, and many consider it their home. Though it would have been nice to have been given a longer send off. The final scene is about 30 seconds and then it's over.

3974,I think I finally figured out Star Trek's main problem.,1598847780,"Since 2009, Star Trek has not stopped trying incredibly hard to be cool.

This post obviously excludes Lower Decks.

But I was thinking about TOS/TNG/DS9/VOY/ENT, and they all completely and totally lean into what they are. Even when ENT had those dumb decon scenes, that was barely anything compared to what 2009-Present Trek tries now.

Current Trek is trying so hard to be something else and THAT is what has caused the root problem which leads to bad writing, behind the scenes shake ups, weird choices, etc.

I'm not saying Trek can't do something new. DS9 was drastically different than TNG, even more so at the time. Trek can be new, but it needs to be Trek. So don't tell me ""oh you just want cardboard sets"" or ""tv is different now.""

And I don't think it has anything to do with serial vs episodic either. We had both in Trek before.

Think of the television landscape when TNG aired in syndication. You had adventure shows like Xena and Highlander. And TNG didn't ""try to be cool"" like it does now, it TRIED TO BE STAR TREK. It was a space adventure show. It was dorky. It was nerdy. And guess what? Because it was good, it got fans. 

Look at the Arrowverse shows on the CW. Nowadays they are extremely comic booky, and they are successful! They lean into what they are. But it wasn't always this way.

When Arrow started, the Marvel Cinematic Universe wasn't a thing. The ""best"" superhero movie was the realistic, non comic booky Nolan Batman movies. So Arrow imitated that and he didn't even have a proper mask or the name ""Green Arrow."" But the CW changed and adapted and now they have like 5 or 7 shows or something. All not ashamed to honor the source material. They now have true to comic costumes and follow comic plotlines. They gave the fans what they wanted and have been rewarded.

Star Trek COULD be like this. If it stopped trying so hard to be The Game of Thrones for CBS All Access (this is what they said Disco was trying to be before it came out), or the Logan movie (Picard) or basically any explodey, camera spinning, frantic dialogue, no breathing room, non sensical plot, special effects, all flash and no substance fest show that it is trying so hard to emulate, then maybe we could have actual Star Trek again. Movies that aren't summer popcorn action movies starring beautiful people with shit plots.

Imagine a Star Trek show that lived on the CW alongside those DC shows, where they are not afraid to have crazy superhero costumes and the Trek Show would not be afraid to be actual Star Trek instead of a shitty syfy channel level mess that is practically Trek in name only.

Lord of the Rings is not cool. Star Wars is not cool. But they have tons of fans and they don't try to be anything other than what they are.

Star Trek isn't about the good looking faces of a Chris Pine or Zoe Saldana. Or the whatever Disco season 1 was.

Star Trek needs to stop trying to be cool. It always found its audience before, and it will again, just fine. Hopefully Strange New Worlds will be this.

3985,"On the name ""Jack Ransom"" from LD; i.e. why is that name familiar?",1598827454,"Back in DS9, there was the quartet of genetically enhanced humans that Bashir had dealings with in ""Statistical Probabilities"" (S06E09) and ""Chrysalis"" (S07E05), the ones who couldn't fit into society. Of that quartet, the character named Jack (no last name) was played by an actor named Tim Ransom. That's the connection my mind made with the name ""Jack Ransom"".

Coincidence? Most likely YES, but I could see a scenario where the writers are trying to come up with names and make the mental slip of thinking Jack's last name was Ransom.",startrek,Seekerman,False,/r/startrek/comments/ijmbsn/on_the_name_jack_ransom_from_ld_ie_why_is_that/,0

3987,Just watched Til Death Do Us Part (DS9) for the first time,1598822112,"What the *actual hell* were the writers thinking???

Look, I gave Penumbra a pass because the Worf/Dax thing made *some* sense and they needed some closure after Jadzia’s sudden death, but seriously. Dax and Julian? And the Kai Winn/Dukat thing just came out of nowhere and not in a good way, it’s like the writers  pulled 2 major characters out of a hat to get together for no apparent reason- it legitimately read like a bad fanfiction and definitely not something out of a well established Star Trek show.

Also Anjohl looks exactly like Dukat just without like gray skin. How did Kai Winn not recognize him, one of the most hated Cardassians on Bajor, while he literally mentions Dukat in conversation with her?

Even the wedding scene with Sisko and Kasidy Yates was a bit boring, especially compared with the other in universe weddings from Data’s Day or You are Cordially Invited- they definitely could’ve done a bit better here.

 I love DS9 but no. Slightly disappointing beginning of the end.
